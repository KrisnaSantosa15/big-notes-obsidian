1. A company built a deep learning model for object detection and deployed the model to production. Which AI process occurs when the model analyzes a new image to identify objects?

A. Training
B. Inference
C. Model deployment
D. Bias correction

**Correct answer:** B. Inference

Inference is the stage in the machine learning lifecycle where a trained and deployed model is used to make predictions on new, previously unseen data. The scenario describes an already-built object detection model analyzing a new image to identify objects. This act of generating a prediction (the identified objects) from new input (the image) is the definition of inference. The training and deployment phases have already been completed. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Training: This is the process of teaching the model by feeding it a labeled dataset. The question states the model is already built, so this phase is complete. C. Model deployment: This is the process of integrating a trained model into a production environment. The question specifies the model has already been deployed. D. Bias correction: This is a specific procedure to mitigate systematic errors or unfairness in a model, not the general term for making a prediction.

2. AI and ML Concepts A company wants to develop ML applications to improve business operations and efficiency. Select the correct ML paradigm from the following list for each use case. Each ML paradigm should be selected one or more times. (Select FOUR.)

**Prompts:**
- Binary classification
- Multi-class classification
- K-means clustering
- Dimensionality reduction

**Term Bank:**
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning

**Correct answer:** Binary classification → Supervised learning | Multi-class classification → Supervised learning | K-means clustering → Unsupervised learning | Dimensionality reduction → Unsupervised learning

Classification tasks, whether binary (two possible outcomes) or multi-class (three or more possible outcomes), require labeled training data to teach the model how to categorize new, unseen data correctly. Therefore, they fall under supervised learning. Conversely, K-means clustering organizes unlabeled data into groups based on feature similarity. Dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal Component Analysis) compress data and identify structural patterns without reference to known target variables. Both clustering and dimensionality reduction operate without labeled outputs, making them unsupervised learning techniques.

3. A company is building a customer service chatbot. The company wants the chatbot to improve its responses by learning from past interactions and online resources. Which AI learning strategy provides this self-improvement capability?

A. Supervised learning with a manually curated dataset of good responses and bad responses
B. Reinforcement learning with rewards for positive customer feedback
C. Unsupervised learning to find clusters of similar customer inquiries
D. Supervised learning with a continuously updated FAQ database

**Correct answer:** B. Reinforcement learning with rewards for positive customer feedback

Reinforcement learning (RL) is the most suitable strategy for this scenario. In RL, an agent (the chatbot) learns optimal behavior by interacting with an environment (the customer). It takes actions (generating responses) and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties (positive or negative customer feedback). The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. This process enables the chatbot to continuously refine its responses based on the outcomes of past interactions, achieving the desired self-improvement capability. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Supervised learning with a manually curated dataset of good responses and bad responses: This approach trains a model on a fixed, pre-labeled dataset and does not involve learning from live, dynamic interactions with users. C. Unsupervised learning to find clusters of similar customer inquiries: This is used for pattern discovery, such as identifying common customer issue types, but it does not train the chatbot on how to respond or improve its answers. D. Supervised learning with a continuously updated FAQ database: While updating the data source improves the model's knowledge base, the learning paradigm is still supervised and lacks the interactive, feedback-driven self-improvement mechanism of RL.

4. Which option is an example of unsupervised learning?

A. A model that groups customers based on their purchase history
B. A model that classifies images as dogs or cats
C. A model that predicts a house's price based on various features
D. A model that learns to play chess by using trial and error

**Correct answer:** A. A model that groups customers based on their purchase history

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures. The task of grouping customers based on their purchase history is a classic example of clustering, a primary unsupervised learning technique. The model identifies natural segments (clusters) within the customer data without any predefined labels, aiming to group similar customers together. This helps businesses understand their customer base for targeted marketing and personalization. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B: Classifying images with predefined labels ('dog' or 'cat') is a supervised learning classification task, as it learns from labeled data. C: Predicting a house's price (a continuous value) from labeled data (features and known prices) is a supervised learning regression task. D: A model learning to play a game through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties is an example of reinforcement learning.

✔ Domain 2: Fundamentals of Generative AI · Multiple choice

5. Sometimes generative AI models generate data unrelated to the input or the task. Which term is used for this disadvantage of using generative AI for business problems?

A. Interpretability
B. Hallucinations
C. Data bias
D. Nondeterminism

**Correct answer:** B. Hallucinations

Hallucination is the term used when a generative AI model produces outputs that are nonsensical, factually incorrect, or disconnected from the provided input context. This occurs because the model generates content based on patterns in its training data rather than a true understanding or grounding in reality. For business problems, this can lead to misinformation and unreliable results, representing a significant disadvantage. The model essentially "invents" information that was not present in the source material. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Interpretability refers to the difficulty in understanding how or why a model arrived at a specific output, not the generation of unrelated data. C. Data bias is when a model produces systematically prejudiced results due to underlying biases in its training data, which is a different issue. D. Nondeterminism means the model can produce different outputs for the same input on different runs, which doesn't specifically mean the output is unrelated.

8. Which option is an example of unsupervised learning?

A. Clustering data points into groups based on their similarity
B. Training a model to recognize images of animals
C. Predicting the price of a house based on the house's features
D. Generating human-like text based on a given prompt

**Correct answer:** A. Clustering data points into groups based on their similarity

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model works with unlabeled data to find patterns or structures on its own. Clustering is a primary example of this, where the algorithm groups data points into distinct clusters based on their inherent similarities. The system is not told what the groups represent; it identifies them based on the data's characteristics. For instance, it could group customers based on purchasing behavior without prior labels. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Training a model to recognize images of animals is a classification task. It requires a labeled dataset (images with corresponding animal names), which is characteristic of supervised learning. C. Predicting the price of a house is a regression task. This is a form of supervised learning because the model is trained on a dataset with known features and corresponding prices (labels). D. Generating human-like text is a generative AI task. While the underlying models are often pre-trained using self-supervised methods, this is a more complex area and not the most direct or fundamental example of unsupervised learning compared to clustering.

13. A company wants to use an AI model to generate labels for online news articles that the company publishes. The company selects a foundation model (FM) instead of a conventional ML model for this task. What is one advantage of using an FM instead of a conventional ML model to meet this requirement?

A. An FM does not require training.
B. An FM is smaller and faster.
C. An FM is more transparent.
D. An FM is not biased.

**Correct answer:** A. An FM does not require training.

Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on massive, diverse datasets, which allows them to perform a wide range of tasks with little to no task-specific training. For a task like labeling news articles, an FM can be used directly through prompting (zero-shot learning) or with minimal examples (few-shot learning). This eliminates the need to collect a large, labeled dataset and train a conventional machine learning model from scratch, significantly reducing development time and data acquisition costs. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. An FM is smaller and faster. This is incorrect. Foundation models are characterized by their massive size (billions of parameters), making them significantly larger and often slower for inference than smaller, task-specific conventional models. C. An FM is more transparent. This is incorrect. Due to their immense scale and complexity, FMs are often considered "black boxes." Their decision-making processes are much harder to interpret than those of many simpler, conventional models. D. An FM is not biased. This is incorrect. FMs are trained on vast amounts of real-world data from the internet, which contains inherent human biases. These biases are learned by the model and can be reflected or amplified in its outputs.

**Prompts:**
- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3

**Term Bank:**
- Store meeting audio recordings in an Amazon S3 bucket.
- Convert meeting audio recordings to meeting text files by using Amazon Transcribe.
- Summarize meeting text files by using Amazon Bedrock.

**Correct answer:** Step 1 → Store meeting audio recordings in an Amazon S3 bucket. | Step 2 → Convert meeting audio recordings to meeting text files by using Amazon Transcribe. | Step 3 → Summarize meeting text files by using Amazon Bedrock.

To build an application that summarizes audio recordings using AWS services, the architectural flow must move from storage to transcription, and finally to summarization.First, the audio files must be uploaded to object storage. Amazon Transcribe processes batch transcription jobs by reading audio data directly from an Amazon S3 bucket, making S3 the required storage solution rather than Amazon EBS, which is block storage for EC2 instances. Second, Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service specifically designed to convert audio and video into text. Amazon Polly is incorrect here as it performs the reverse operation (Text-to-Speech). Finally, Amazon Bedrock provides access to generative AI foundation models (FMs) that are perfectly suited for natural language processing tasks like text summarization. Amazon Lex is incorrect because it is designed for building conversational interfaces (chatbots), not for batch text summarization.

C. Use all the PDF documents to fine-tune a model with Amazon Bedrock. Use the fine-tuned model to process user prompts.
D. Upload PDF documents to an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. Use the knowledge base to provide context when users submit prompts to Amazon Bedrock.

**Correct answer:** D. Upload PDF documents to an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. Use the knowledge base to provide context when users submit prompts to Amazon Bedrock.

The most cost-effective and scalable solution is to use a Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock. This feature is specifically designed for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique where relevant information is retrieved from a private data source (the PDF manuals) and provided to the Large Language Model (LLM) as context at inference time. This approach avoids the high costs associated with fine-tuning a model and the impracticality of passing large documents in every prompt. The knowledge base handles the entire RAG workflow, including data ingestion, vectorization, and retrieval, providing a managed and cost-efficient way to ground the LLM's responses in the company's specific data. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Passing a single PDF file in the prompt is not scalable, may exceed the model's context window limit, and is inefficient as it requires sending large amounts of data with each query. B. Passing all PDF files in the prompt is technically infeasible due to LLM context window limitations and would be prohibitively expensive because of the massive number of input tokens per query. C. Fine-tuning is a more expensive process than RAG, both in terms of initial training costs and potentially hosting a custom model. It is less suitable for knowledge augmentation, especially when the source data (manuals) may change.

Each inference mode should be selected one or more times. (Select THREE.)

**Prompts:**
- Scenario 1 (Chatbot / minimal latency)
- Scenario 2 (Data processing job / gigabytes of text / weekends)
- Scenario 3 (API / small pieces of text / low-latency predictions)

**Term Bank:**
- Real-time inference
- Batch transform

**Correct answer:** Scenario 1 (Chatbot / minimal latency) → Real-time inference | Scenario 2 (Data processing job / gigabytes of text / weekends) → Batch transform | Scenario 3 (API / small pieces of text / low-latency predictions) → Real-time inference

Amazon SageMaker offers different inference options depending on workload requirements. • Real-time inference is designed for interactive workloads that have sub-millisecond latency requirements, such as chatbots or synchronous APIs serving small payloads. It provisions a persistent endpoint to process requests on demand. • Batch transform is the optimal choice for offline processing of large datasets where low latency is not required. It does not require a persistent endpoint; it spins up resources, processes the dataset (like gigabytes of text on a weekend), and tears the resources down once the job is complete, making it highly cost-effective for scheduled tasks.

27. A company wants to assess the costs that are associated with using a large language model (LLM) to generate inferences. The company wants to use Amazon Bedrock to build generative AI applications. Which factor will drive the inference costs?

A. Number of tokens consumed
B. Temperature value
C. Amount of data used to train the LLM
D. Total training time

**Correct answer:** A. Number of tokens consumed

The cost of generating inferences with large language models (LLMs) on Amazon Bedrock is primarily determined by the volume of data processed, which is measured in tokens. Pricing is calculated based on the number of input tokens (the prompt) sent to the model and the number of output tokens (the response) generated by the model. Different models available through Bedrock have different per-token rates for input and output, but the fundamental cost driver for inference is the total token consumption. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Temperature value: This is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the model's output; it is not a direct billing factor. It can indirectly influence cost by affecting the length of the generated response, but the charge is based on the resulting token count, not the temperature setting itself. C. Amount of data used to train the LLM: This is a cost associated with the initial development and training of the model, which is incurred by the model provider. It is not a cost factor for a user performing inference on a pre-trained model. D. Total training time: Similar to the amount of training data, the time spent training the model is a development cost. End-user inference costs are based on usage (tokens processed), not the historical training time of the model.

28. A company wants to develop an educational game where users answer questions such as the following: "A jar contains six red, four green, and three yellow marbles. What is the probability of choosing a green marble from the jar?" Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Use supervised learning to create a regression model that will predict probability.
B. Use reinforcement learning to train a model to return the probability.
C. Use code that will calculate probability by using simple rules and computations.
D. Use unsupervised learning to create a model that will estimate probability density.

**Correct answer:** C. Use code that will calculate probability by using simple rules and computations.

The question describes a problem that can be solved with a deterministic, rule-based mathematical formula: Probability = (Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Outcomes). This requires simple arithmetic, not machine learning. Implementing this with a few lines of code is the most direct, accurate, and efficient solution. It incurs minimal development effort and virtually no ongoing operational overhead for maintenance, monitoring, or retraining. The other options propose using complex machine learning models, which are unnecessary and introduce significant operational overhead, directly contradicting the question's primary constraint. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Use supervised learning to create a regression model that will predict probability. This is incorrect because supervised learning is for predicting outcomes based on patterns in data. It is unnecessary for a problem with a fixed mathematical formula and adds high operational overhead. B. Use reinforcement learning to train a model to return the probability. This is incorrect because reinforcement learning is designed for training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment. It is completely unsuited for a direct calculation problem. D. Use unsupervised learning to create a model that will estimate probability density. This is incorrect because unsupervised learning is used to find hidden structures in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering). It is not the appropriate tool for solving a specific, rule-based calculation. ---

A. Website engagement rate
B. Average call duration
C. Corporate social responsibility
D. Regulatory compliance

**Correct answer:** B. Average call duration

The primary goal is to reduce the workload on call center employees. The most direct way to measure this among the given options is by tracking a key performance indicator (KPI) related to call center operations. "Average call duration" is a standard contact center metric that measures the average time an agent spends on a call. An effective LLM chatbot can answer common customer questions, deflecting simpler calls from the center or providing agents with quick answers, thereby reducing the time they need to spend on each interaction. This directly reflects a decrease in the actions and time required by employees, aligning perfectly with the stated business objective. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Website engagement rate: This metric measures user interaction with the website, not the direct impact on call center workload. High engagement with the chatbot does not guarantee a reduction in calls. C. Corporate social responsibility: This is a broad, qualitative business principle concerning a company's societal impact and is not a specific, measurable metric for evaluating a chatbot's operational efficiency. D. Regulatory compliance: This is a mandatory requirement or constraint for the system's operation, not a business objective used to measure its effectiveness in reducing employee workload.

33. A company wants to use language models to create an application for inference on edge devices. The inference must have the lowest latency possible. Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Deploy optimized small language models (SLMs) on edge devices.
B. Deploy optimized large language models (LLMs) on edge devices.
C. Incorporate a centralized small language model (SLM) API for asynchronous communication with edge devices.
D. Incorporate a centralized large language model (LLM) API for asynchronous communication with edge devices.

**Correct answer:** A. Deploy optimized small language models (SLMs) on edge devices.

To achieve the lowest possible latency for inference, the processing must occur locally on the edge device itself. This eliminates the network round-trip time required to communicate with a centralized cloud-based API. Small language models (SLMs) are specifically designed to be computationally efficient and have a smaller memory footprint compared to large language models (LLMs). Deploying an optimized SLM directly on the edge device is the most effective strategy to meet the strict low-latency requirement within the typical resource constraints of such hardware. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Deploy optimized large language models (LLMs) on edge devices. Large language models are generally too large and computationally demanding for low-latency performance on resource-constrained edge devices, even when optimized. C. Incorporate a centralized small language model (SLM) API for asynchronous communication with edge devices. Using a centralized API introduces network latency for every inference request, which is fundamentally slower than on-device processing and fails the "lowest latency" requirement. D. Incorporate a centralized large language model (LLM) API for asynchronous communication with edge devices. This option has the highest potential latency, as it combines the network delay of a centralized API with the typically longer processing time of an LLM.

A. Fine-tune the model by using additional training data that is representative of the various age ranges that the application will support.
B. Add a role description to the prompt context that instructs the model of the age range that the response should target.
C. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to deduce the correct style and complexity for a response suitable for that user.
D. Summarize the response text depending on the age of the user so that younger users receive shorter responses.

**Correct answer:** B. Add a role description to the prompt context that instructs the model of the age range that the response should target.

Prompt engineering is the most efficient method to control the output of a generative AI model with minimal effort. By adding a role description or persona (e.g., "You are an expert explaining this concept to a 10-year-old") directly into the prompt, the model can leverage its existing knowledge to adapt its tone, vocabulary, and complexity. This technique, also known as in-context learning, requires no changes to the model itself, no additional training data, and only a minor modification to the application's input string. It directly addresses the requirement for the least implementation effort compared to more complex methods like fine-tuning or multi-step processing. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Fine-tuning requires curating a large, specialized dataset and retraining the model, which is a highly complex, time-consuming, and expensive process. C. Chain-of-thought reasoning is a technique to improve a model's ability to solve complex, multi-step problems, not to control the stylistic attributes of its response. D. Summarizing the response after generation is a multi-step process that adds complexity and primarily controls length, not the fundamental style, vocabulary, or analogies used.

Which strategy will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Fine-tune the model regularly.
B. Train the model by using context data.
C. Pre-train and benchmark the model by using context data.
D. Use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with prompt engineering techniques.

**Correct answer:** D. Use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with prompt engineering techniques.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architectural pattern designed to provide large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date, external information without retraining or fine-tuning the model itself. In this scenario, the company's frequently asked questions can be stored in a knowledge base (e.g., a vector database). When an agent asks a question, the RAG system first retrieves the most relevant documents from this knowledge base and then passes them to the LLM as context within the prompt. This approach is highly cost-effective because updating the knowledge base is inexpensive and fast, completely avoiding the significant computational costs associated with retraining or regularly fine-tuning the foundational model. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Fine-tuning the model regularly is computationally expensive and time-consuming, making it unsuitable for a cost-effective solution with frequently changing data. B. Training a model from scratch using context data is the most expensive and complex option, requiring massive resources and is not a viable strategy for this use case. C.

72. A company wants to create a chatbot to answer employee questions about company policies. Company policies are updated frequently. The chatbot must reflect the changes in near real time. The company wants to choose a large language model (LLM).

A. Fine-tune an LLM on the company policy text by using Amazon SageMaker.
B. Select a foundation model (FM) from Amazon Bedrock to build an application.
C. Create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow by using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.
D. Use Amazon Q Business to build a custom Q App.

**Correct answer:** C. Create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow by using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

The most critical requirements are that company policies are updated frequently and the chatbot must reflect these changes in near real time. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture is specifically designed for this use case. RAG enables a large language model (LLM) to access and incorporate information from external, dynamic data sources at the time of inference, without needing to be retrained. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is a fully managed service that automates the RAG workflow. It handles the ingestion of documents (company policies), converts them into vector embeddings, and stores them. When a query is made, it retrieves the most relevant, up-to-date policy information and provides it as context to the LLM to generate an accurate answer. This is significantly faster and more cost-effective than fine-tuning for knowledge-intensive, frequently changing domains. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Fine-tuning is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. Re-training the LLM for every frequent policy update is impractical and fails to meet the "near real time" requirement. B. Simply selecting a foundation model is insufficient. A base model has no knowledge of the company's specific and current policies, leading to inaccurate or generic responses. D. While Amazon Q Business is a valid solution that uses RAG internally, it is a higher-level, fully managed application. Option C describes the specific architectural pattern (RAG) and service (Bedrock Knowledge Bases) that directly and fundamentally solves the stated technical problem.

A. The average revenue per user (ARPU) over the past month
B. The number of daily interactions by basic subscription users
C. The conversion rate and the customer retention rate
D. The decrease in the number of premium customer queries and issue volume

**Correct answer:** C. The conversion rate and the customer retention rate

To evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for a new feature, a company must measure the financial impact it generates. The generative AI solution is a premium feature designed to attract new premium subscribers and retain existing ones. The conversion rate measures the effectiveness of the feature in persuading basic users to upgrade to a paid premium subscription, directly impacting revenue growth. The customer retention rate measures the feature's success in keeping existing premium subscribers, which prevents revenue loss (churn). Together, these two metrics provide the most direct and comprehensive measure of the revenue generated and protected by the AI investment, which is essential for calculating ROI. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. The average revenue per user (ARPU) is a general metric and may not isolate the specific impact of the new feature without complex segmentation and analysis. B. The AI feature is for premium users, so tracking interactions from basic subscription users is irrelevant to measuring the ROI of this specific investment. D.

D. To evaluate user inputs and orchestrate actions for multiple tasks

**Correct answer:** D. To evaluate user inputs and orchestrate actions for multiple tasks

Amazon Bedrock Agents are a fully managed capability designed to automate complex business tasks. An agent acts as an orchestrator by taking a user's natural language request, evaluating the intent, and breaking it down into a multi-step plan. It then orchestrates the execution of this plan by invoking the necessary foundation models (FMs), querying knowledge bases for relevant information, and calling external APIs through action groups to fulfill the user's request. This orchestration is the core function of an agent in automating workflows. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. This describes the general capability of a foundation model (FM) itself, not the specific orchestration and task-automation function of an Amazon Bedrock Agent. B. Prompting is a method used to interact with and guide an agent or FM, but it is not the primary purpose or function of the agent itself. C. Agents use external data sources and APIs to perform actions, but they orchestrate this access based on a plan, rather than providing users with direct, full control.

A. Immediately start training a custom FM by using the company's existing data.
B. Conduct stakeholder interviews to refine use cases and set measurable goals.
C. Implement a prebuilt AI assistant solution and measure its impact on customer satisfaction.
D. Analyze industry AI implementations and replicate the most successful features.

**Correct answer:** B. Conduct stakeholder interviews to refine use cases and set measurable goals.

The most effective approach for any AI implementation, including generative AI, is to begin by clearly defining the business problem and objectives. Conducting stakeholder interviews is a critical first step to refine abstract goals like "improve marketing" into specific, actionable use cases (e.g., generating personalized email copy, creating ad variants). This process ensures the project is aligned with business needs and establishes key performance indicators (KPIs) and measurable goals (e.g., increase conversion rates by 15%) that directly tie back to the primary objective of increasing revenue. This foundational work prevents wasted resources on solutions that do not address the core business challenge. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Immediately starting to train a custom model is a technology-first approach that skips the crucial problem-framing phase, leading to high costs and potential project failure. C. Implementing a prebuilt solution without prior analysis is premature. Furthermore, it focuses on customer satisfaction, which is a secondary metric, not the primary goal of increasing revenue. D. Replicating competitor features ignores the company's unique context, data, and customer base, which may lead to an ineffective or irrelevant solution.

A. Low latency and high throughput
B. Adaptability and responsiveness
C. Deterministic outputs and fixed responses
D. Hardware acceleration and GPU optimization

**Correct answer:** B. Adaptability and responsiveness

Generative AI models, such as large language models (LLMs), are designed to understand context, nuance, and semantic meaning in human language. Their adaptability allows them to process and comprehend various phrasings of the same underlying question, moving beyond simple keyword matching. Their responsiveness enables them to generate new, coherent, and contextually relevant answers on the fly. This combination is ideal for creating an AI assistant that can provide consistent and helpful responses to a wide array of user queries, rather than being limited to a rigid, predefined script. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong A. Low latency and high throughput: These are system performance metrics. While desirable, they are not inherent functional advantages of generative AI itself; large models can often have high latency. C. Deterministic outputs and fixed responses: This describes rule-based or traditional systems. Generative AI is inherently probabilistic (stochastic), designed to create novel outputs, not fixed ones. D. Hardware acceleration and GPU optimization: These are implementation and infrastructure requirements needed to run large models efficiently, not a core capability or advantage of the AI technology for this use case. --- References 1.

A. Open-ended generation
B. Text summarization
C. Machine translation
D. Classification

**Correct answer:** D. Classification

The problem described is sentiment analysis, which is a classic example of a text classification task. The goal is to assign a piece of text (a customer review) to one of several predefined, discrete categories or classes ('neutral', 'positive', or 'negative'). The model is trained on labeled data to learn the patterns associated with each sentiment class and then uses this knowledge to classify new, unlabeled reviews. This process of categorizing input into a finite set of labels is the definition of classification. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Open-ended generation involves creating new, original text, not assigning a label to existing text. B. Text summarization creates a shorter, condensed version of a text, which is not the goal here.

C. Develop an anomaly detection system.
D. Create a fraud forecasting system.

**Correct answer:** C. Develop an anomaly detection system.

The core requirement is to identify an IP address from a "suspicious source." In the context of network traffic, a suspicious source is one that deviates from normal, expected behavior. Anomaly detection is the branch of AI/ML specifically designed to identify rare items, events, or observations that differ significantly from the majority of the data. An anomaly detection system can establish a baseline of normal network traffic patterns and then flag IP addresses exhibiting unusual activity (e.g., sudden spike in requests, access from an unusual location) as potential threats. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Speech recognition systems are used to convert spoken language into text and are not applicable to analyzing network traffic or IP addresses for security threats. B. Natural language processing (NLP) is used for understanding and processing human language. Named entity recognition is a sub-task that identifies entities in text, which is irrelevant here. D. A forecasting system predicts future values or trends based on historical data. While related to security, the immediate need is to detect a current threat, not predict future ones.

Hard-coded, rule-based systems are inherently rigid and brittle; they must be manually updated for every new scenario, product name, or linguistic nuance. Generative AI models, especially foundation models, are pre-trained on vast, diverse datasets. This allows them to generalize and understand new contexts, terminologies, and languages without requiring explicit reprogramming. This inherent adaptability directly solves the company's problem by providing a flexible solution that can scale efficiently to handle varied consumer complaints from different sources. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Predictability of outputs: Generative AI models can produce varied and creative outputs, making them less predictable than deterministic, hard-coded logic. C. Less sensitivity to changes in inputs: These models are highly sensitive to input phrasing (prompting), which is a key mechanism for controlling their behavior; they are not less sensitive. D. Explainability: Explaining the reasoning behind a specific output from a large, complex neural network is a significant challenge (the "black box" problem), making them less explainable than traceable, hard-coded rules. ---

A. Text data
B. Image data
C. Time series data
D. Binary data

**Correct answer:** C. Time series data

The Amazon SageMaker DeepAR algorithm is a supervised learning model specifically designed for forecasting scalar (one-dimensional) time series. The scenario describes predicting future product demand based on historical data, which is a classic time series forecasting problem. DeepAR analyzes past time-ordered data points (e.g., daily or weekly sales figures) to learn seasonalities and trends, and then uses this learned model to predict future values. Therefore, time series data is the required input format for the DeepAR algorithm to fulfill the retail store's requirement. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Text data: This data type is used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis or text classification, not for forecasting numerical demand with DeepAR. B. Image data: This data is used for computer vision tasks such as image classification or object detection and is not suitable for predicting demand over time. D.

104. A company wants to develop a large language model (LLM) application by using Amazon Bedrock and customer data that is uploaded to Amazon S3. The company's security policy states that each team can access data for only the team's own customers. Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon Bedrock custom service role for each team that has access to only the team's customer data.
B. Create a custom service role that has Amazon S3 access. Ask teams to specify the customer name on each Amazon Bedrock request.
C. Redact personal data in Amazon S3. Update the S3 bucket policy to allow team access to customer data.
D. Create one Amazon Bedrock role that has full Amazon S3 access. Create IAM roles for each team that have access to only each team's customer folders.

**Correct answer:** A. Create an Amazon Bedrock custom service role for each team that has access to only the team's customer data.

The most secure and appropriate method to enforce team-specific data access for Amazon Bedrock is by using distinct AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. By creating a unique Amazon Bedrock custom service role for each team, you can attach an IAM policy to each role that explicitly grants access only to the specific Amazon S3 prefixes (folders) containing that team's customer data. When a team initiates a Bedrock job (like model fine-tuning), they use their designated role. Bedrock then assumes this role, inheriting its narrowly-scoped permissions, thus ensuring it can only read data from the authorized S3 location. This approach adheres to the principle of least privilege. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. A single, broadly permissive service role violates the principle of least privilege. Relying on application-level parameters for security is unreliable and not an IAM-enforced control. C. Data redaction is a data privacy technique, but it does not solve the access control requirement of isolating one team's data from another. D. If the single Amazon Bedrock role has full S3 access, it becomes a security vulnerability. The permissions of the service role that Bedrock assumes are what matter for accessing S3, not the team's user/role permissions for invoking Bedrock.

105. A company is introducing a new feature for its application. The feature will refine the style of output messages. The company will fine-tune a large language model (LLM) on Amazon Bedrock to implement the feature. Which type of data does the company need to meet these requirements?

A. Samples of only input messages
B. Samples of only output messages
C. Samples of pairs of input and output messages
D. Separate samples of input and output messages

**Correct answer:** C. Samples of pairs of input and output messages

Supervised fine-tuning for a large language model (LLM) is a process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task. To refine the style of output messages, the model must learn the relationship between an input and the desired stylized output. This requires a training dataset composed of example pairs, where each pair consists of a sample input (the prompt) and its corresponding ideal output (the completion). By training on these pairs, the model learns to generate outputs in the target style when given similar inputs. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Samples of only input messages: This is incorrect because the model would not have any examples of the desired output style to learn from. B. Samples of only output messages: This is incorrect because the model would not know which input corresponds to a given output, preventing it from learning the transformation task. D. Separate samples of input and output messages: This is incorrect because unpaired data does not allow the model to learn the specific mapping from a given input to its correctly styled output.

D. Use an optical character recognition model trained on labeled samples to label unlabeled samples
E. Run an Amazon SageMaker AI labeling job

**Correct answer:** C. Use an Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth labeling job with Amazon Mechanical Turk workers

The primary challenge is to label a large volume of unlabeled, non-confidential data to create a training dataset. Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth is the dedicated AWS service designed for this exact purpose. It facilitates data labeling by using human annotators. Since the transaction data is not confidential, the company can utilize the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce, which is a scalable, on-demand, public workforce integrated with SageMaker Ground Truth. This approach is cost-effective and efficient for labeling large datasets, directly fulfilling the company's need to obtain labeled sample data for model fine-tuning. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Run batch inference jobs on the unlabeled data: Batch inference is for generating predictions on data using a trained model, not for creating labeled data to train a model. B. Run an Amazon SageMaker AI training job that uses the PyTorch Distributed library to label data: A SageMaker training job's purpose is to train a model using an existing labeled dataset, not to perform the initial data labeling. D. Use an optical character recognition model trained on labeled samples to label unlabeled samples: Optical character recognition (OCR) is used to extract text from images. Credit card transaction data is typically tabular, not image-based. E. Run an Amazon SageMaker AI labeling job: This option is too generic. Option C is more specific and accurate by naming the service (SageMaker Ground Truth) and the appropriate workforce (Mechanical Turk).

C. Configure SageMaker to use a VPC with an S3 endpoint.
D. Configure SageMaker to use S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

**Correct answer:** C. Configure SageMaker to use a VPC with an S3 endpoint.

Configuring Amazon SageMaker Studio to operate within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and using a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 is the correct solution for managing the data flow. This architecture ensures that the traffic between the SageMaker Studio notebook and the S3 bucket does not traverse the public internet. Instead, it is routed securely and privately over the AWS network. This provides enhanced security, improved performance, and granular control over data access through VPC security groups and endpoint policies, directly addressing the need to manage the data flow. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Use Amazon Inspector to monitor SageMaker Studio. Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that scans workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure; it does not manage or control data traffic paths between services. B. Use Amazon Macie to monitor SageMaker Studio. Amazon Macie is a data security service that discovers and protects sensitive data stored in Amazon S3. It does not manage the network flow of data to other services like SageMaker. D. Configure SageMaker to use S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

The data is encrypted with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). The FM encounters a failure when attempting to access the S3 bucket data. Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Ensure that the role that Amazon Bedrock assumes has permission to decrypt data with the correct encryption key.
B. Set the access permissions for the S3 buckets to allow public access to enable access over the internet.
C. Use prompt engineering techniques to tell the model to look for information in Amazon S3.
D. Ensure that the S3 data does not contain sensitive information.

**Correct answer:** A. Ensure that the role that Amazon Bedrock assumes has permission to decrypt data with the correct encryption key.

Amazon Bedrock requires permissions to access other AWS resources, such as Amazon S3, on your behalf. It accomplishes this by assuming an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. When data in an S3 bucket is encrypted (using any method, including SSE-S3), the IAM role that Bedrock assumes must have a policy attached that grants it the necessary permissions to access the objects (e.g., s3:GetObject). A failure to access the data indicates that this role lacks the required permissions. Therefore, the solution is to ensure the role has the correct permissions to access and, by extension, decrypt the data in the S3 bucket. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Setting S3 bucket permissions to public is a major security risk and violates the principle of least privilege. It is not the correct way to grant a specific service access. C. Prompt engineering is used to guide the output of a foundation model. It does not configure the underlying service permissions needed to access external data sources. D. The sensitivity of the data is a data governance concern. Removing sensitive information does not resolve the technical access failure, which is caused by a permissions issue.

A diverse dataset helps prevent sampling bias, ensuring the model learns from a wide range of examples and can make accurate predictions for all customer groups, not just the majority or a specific subset. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Accuracy: Accuracy is a metric used to evaluate a model's performance after it has been trained; it is not a characteristic of the data collection process itself. C. Recency bias: This type of bias occurs when a model gives more importance to recent data. The scenario does not mention the timing of data collection. D. Reliability: Data reliability refers to the consistency and trustworthiness of the data. While important, the specific goal of including all demographics addresses variety, not just consistency.

116. Which option describes embeddings in the context of AI?

A. A method for compressing large datasets
B. An encryption method for securing sensitive data
C. A method for visualizing high-dimensional data
D. A numerical method for data representation in a reduced dimensionality space

**Correct answer:** D. A numerical method for data representation in a reduced dimensionality space

In artificial intelligence, an embedding is a learned, low-dimensional, and dense vector representation of a discrete or high-dimensional object, such as a word, image, or user. The primary purpose is to capture semantic or syntactic relationships between these objects. For instance, in natural language processing, words with similar meanings are mapped to nearby points in the embedding space. This numerical representation allows machine learning models to process complex, categorical data more efficiently and effectively than sparse representations like one-hot encoding. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Data compression is a side effect of dimensionality reduction, but the main goal of embeddings is to capture semantic relationships, not merely to reduce data size. B. Encryption is a cryptographic process for securing data by making it unreadable. Embeddings are a data representation technique and have no inherent security function. C. While embeddings can be visualized (often using techniques like t-SNE or PCA), their fundamental purpose is data representation for model input, not visualization itself.

121. A financial company is training a generative AI model to predict outcomes of loan applications. The training dataset is small. The dataset categorizes loan applicants as "younger-aged," "middle-aged," or "older-aged." Most individuals in the dataset are characterized as "middle-aged." The company removes the age range feature from the training dataset. Which model behavior will likely happen as a result of this change to the dataset?

A. The model will inaccurately predict outcomes for younger and older age groups.
B. The model will require less training data.
C. The model will predict accurate outcomes for only younger age groups.
D. The model will accurately predict outcomes for all ages.

**Correct answer:** A. The model will inaccurately predict outcomes for younger and older age groups.

The training dataset is described as small and imbalanced, with the "middle-aged" group being overrepresented while "younger-aged" and "older-aged" groups are underrepresented. In such scenarios, a model naturally struggles to learn the patterns for the minority groups due to the scarcity of data. Removing the age feature further compounds this issue by taking away an explicit signal that could help the model differentiate between these groups. The model will likely become biased towards the majority "middle-aged" class, as most of its training examples belong to this group, resulting in poor predictive accuracy for the underrepresented younger and older age groups. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Removing a feature does not reduce the amount of data needed for effective training; in fact, if the feature was informative, more data might be needed to compensate. C. The model will perform poorly on underrepresented groups due to data scarcity, making it highly unlikely to be accurate for only the "younger-aged" group. D. A small, imbalanced dataset, especially after removing a potentially important feature, will almost certainly not produce accurate predictions for all demographic groups.

122. A company is building an AI application to automate business processes. The company uses a foundation model (FM) to support the application. The company needs to select datasets to assess the quality of the AI model's behavior. Which type of datasets will meet these requirements?

A. Curated datasets that have had all outliers and correlations removed
B. Synthetic datasets that have been generated by the newest FM
C. Diverse datasets that cover various use cases and usage scenarios
D. Randomized datasets that have arbitrary features and skewed distributions

**Correct answer:** C. Diverse datasets that cover various use cases and usage scenarios

To comprehensively assess the quality of a foundation model (FM), which is designed to be general-purpose, the evaluation datasets must be diverse. Diverse datasets that cover a wide range of use cases, user inputs, and operational scenarios are essential for uncovering the model's true performance, robustness, and potential biases. Evaluating an FM on a narrow or overly clean dataset would fail to capture its behavior in real-world situations, leading to an inaccurate assessment of its suitability for automating various business processes. This approach aligns with the principles of responsible and reliable AI development. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Curated datasets with outliers and correlations removed are artificially clean and do not represent real-world data, leading to an overly optimistic and inaccurate quality assessment. B. Synthetic datasets generated by another FM can inherit the biases of the generating model and may not accurately reflect the true diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios. D. Randomized datasets with arbitrary features lack the structure and context of real-world problems, making them useless for evaluating a model's performance on meaningful business tasks. ---

A. Purchase Provisioned Throughput for the custom model.
B. Deploy the custom model in an Amazon SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference.
C. Register the model with the Amazon SageMaker Model Registry.
D. Grant access to the custom model in Amazon Bedrock.

**Correct answer:** A. Purchase Provisioned Throughput for the custom model.

After a base model in Amazon Bedrock is fine-tuned, it becomes a custom model. To use this new custom model for inference, you must purchase Provisioned Throughput. This action allocates dedicated, managed inference capacity for the model, ensuring consistent throughput and performance at scale. Without purchasing Provisioned Throughput, the custom model cannot be invoked for summarization or any other task. This is a mandatory step to make a fine-tuned model operational within the Amazon Bedrock service. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Deploying to a SageMaker endpoint is a process for models within the Amazon SageMaker ecosystem, not for custom models trained and served natively through Amazon Bedrock. C. The Amazon SageMaker Model Registry is a feature for cataloging and managing models within SageMaker MLOps pipelines, not a prerequisite for using a Bedrock custom model. D. While IAM permissions are necessary for access control, the specific operational step required to enable inference for a custom Bedrock model is purchasing Provisioned Throughput.

A. To encrypt text data
B. To compress text files
C. To break text into smaller units for processing
D. To translate text between languages

**Correct answer:** C. To break text into smaller units for processing

Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Its primary purpose is to segment a sequence of text into smaller, manageable, and meaningful units called tokens. These tokens can be words, sub-words, or even characters. This process is essential because machine learning models cannot process raw text directly; they require structured, numerical input. Tokenization is the initial step in converting unstructured text into a format that can be analyzed and used for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, or machine translation. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. To encrypt text data: Encryption is a security process for encoding data to prevent unauthorized access, which is distinct from the linguistic preprocessing task of tokenization. B. To compress text files: Compression aims to reduce the storage size of data. Tokenization is a text processing step and is not designed for file size reduction. D. To translate text between languages: Machine translation is a complex NLP application that uses tokenization as a preliminary step, but tokenization itself is not the act of translation.

(Select TWO.)

A. Generation of content embeddings
B. Generation of embeddings for user queries
C. Creation of the search index
D. Retrieval of relevant content
E. Response generation for the user

**Correct answer:** A. Generation of content embeddings | C. Creation of the search index

A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline is divided into two primary phases: an offline data preparation/indexing phase and an online inference/querying phase. To ensure a near real-time experience for users, computationally expensive tasks that are independent of the user query are performed offline in batch. Generating embeddings for the source content (A) and creating the search index (C) are part of this offline phase. These steps process the large corpus of published documents and prepare them for fast retrieval. Since new content is added daily, these tasks can be scheduled as a recurring batch job to update the knowledge base without affecting the performance of live user queries. The remaining steps occur during the online, real-time inference phase once a user submits a query. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Generation of embeddings for user queries: This must be done in real-time as it is dependent on the specific query submitted by the user and is required for the retrieval step. D. Retrieval of relevant content: This is the core search operation that happens in real-time during user interaction, using the query embedding to find matching content in the index. E. Response generation for the user: This is the final step of the real-time inference process, where the language model synthesizes an answer based on the user's query and the retrieved content.

C. Tokens are the pre-trained weights of a generative AI model that are fine-tuned for specific tasks.
D. Tokens are the specific prompts or instructions given to a generative AI model to generate output.

**Correct answer:** A. Tokens are the basic units of input and output that a generative AI model operates on, representing words, subwords, or other linguistic units.

In generative AI, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs), a token is the fundamental unit of data that the model processes. Raw text input is first broken down into these smaller, manageable pieces by a process called tokenization. A token can represent a whole word (e.g., "apple"), a subword (e.g., "token" and "ization" from "tokenization"), a single character, or punctuation. The model operates on these sequences of tokens to understand context and generate a response. This segmentation allows the model to handle a vast vocabulary and understand the structure of language efficiently. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. This describes word embeddings or vectors, which are the numerical, mathematical representations of tokens, not the tokens themselves. C.

A. Data leakage
B. Hallucination
C. Overfitting
D. Underfitting

**Correct answer:** B. Hallucination

The problem described is hallucination. In the context of large language models (LLMs), hallucination refers to the generation of content that is fluent, coherent, and sounds factually plausible but is actually incorrect, nonsensical, or not grounded in the source data. The model essentially "invents" information. This directly matches the scenario where the LLM produces marketing content that seems factual but is wrong. Hallucination is a significant challenge in ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of generative AI outputs. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Data leakage: This is a training-time error where information from outside the training set influences the model, leading to inflated performance metrics, not the generation of plausible but false content. C. Overfitting: This occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and fails to generalize to new data. It results in poor performance, not fabricated facts. D. Underfitting: This is when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and new data, often producing overly generic output.

138. AI and ML Concepts A company wants to build an ML application. Select and order the correct steps from the following list to develop a well-architected ML workload. Each step should be selected one time. (Select and order FOUR.)

**Prompts:**
- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3
- Step 4

**Term Bank:**
- Define business goal and frame ML problem
- Develop model
- Deploy model
- Monitor model

**Correct answer:** Step 1 → Define business goal and frame ML problem | Step 2 → Develop model | Step 3 → Deploy model | Step 4 → Monitor model

Developing a well-architected machine learning workload requires following a structured, sequential ML lifecycle. The first step is always to define the business goal and frame the ML problem. This ensures that the technical solution aligns with organizational objectives and that machine learning is actually the appropriate approach for the problem at hand. Once the problem is framed and the requisite data is gathered and prepared, the next phase is to develop the model. This encompasses building, training, tuning, and evaluating the model's accuracy. After the model meets the required performance thresholds during development, the next logical step is to deploy the model into a production environment where it can generate predictions or inferences on new data. Finally, because real-world data constantly changes, you must monitor the model post-deployment to track its performance, detect data or concept drift, and determine when retraining is necessary.

139. A company has developed an ML model for image classification. The company wants to deploy the model to production so that a web application can use the model. The company needs to implement a solution to host the model and serve predictions without managing any of the underlying infrastructure. Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference to deploy the model.
B. Use Amazon CloudFront to deploy the model.
C. Use Amazon API Gateway to host the model and serve predictions.
D. Use AWS Batch to host the model and serve predictions.

**Correct answer:** A. Use Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference to deploy the model.

Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference is a purpose-built solution designed to deploy machine learning models without managing any underlying infrastructure. It automatically provisions, scales, and manages the required compute resources based on the volume of inference requests. This fully managed experience directly addresses the company's need to host the model and serve predictions for its web application while abstracting away server management. It is ideal for workloads with intermittent or unpredictable traffic patterns, which is common for web applications. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Use Amazon CloudFront to deploy the model. Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) used to cache and deliver web content with low latency, not to host and execute ML model inference logic. C. Use Amazon API Gateway to host the model and serve predictions. Amazon API Gateway is a service for creating and managing APIs. While it can act as a front-end for a model, it does not host or run the model's compute logic itself. D. Use AWS Batch to host the model and serve predictions. AWS Batch is designed for running large-scale, asynchronous batch computing jobs, not for serving real-time, low-latency predictions required by an interactive web application.

140. An AI practitioner needs to improve the accuracy of a natural language generation model. The model uses rapidly changing inventory data. Which technique will improve the model's accuracy?

A. Transfer learning
B. Federated learning
C. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
D. One-shot prompting

**Correct answer:** C. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique designed to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by grounding them in external, up-to-date sources of information. For a model that relies on rapidly changing inventory data, RAG is the ideal solution. At inference time, the system first retrieves the most current inventory information relevant to the user's query from a knowledge base. This retrieved data is then passed to the LLM as context along with the original prompt, enabling the model to generate a response that is accurate and reflects the latest data without requiring constant retraining. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Transfer learning is a training-time technique for adapting a pre-trained model to a new task; it is not designed for incorporating real-time data at inference. B. Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that preserves data privacy; it is not relevant to augmenting a model with a dynamic external knowledge source. D. One-shot prompting is a technique that provides a single example within the prompt to guide the model's output, but it does not solve the core problem of accessing external, changing data.

141. An AI practitioner has trained a model on a training dataset. The model performs well on the training data. However, the model does not perform well on evaluation data. What is the MOST likely cause of this issue?

A. The model is underfit.
B. The model requires prompt engineering.
C. The model is biased.
D. The model is overfit.

**Correct answer:** D. The model is overfit.

Overfitting is a common issue in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and random fluctuations. This results in high performance on the training dataset but poor performance on new, unseen data, such as an evaluation or test dataset. The model has effectively "memorized" the training examples instead of learning the underlying general patterns, which leads to a failure to generalize. The scenario described-good performance on training data and poor performance on evaluation data-is the classic definition of overfitting. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. The model is underfit. An underfit model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and evaluation datasets. B. The model requires prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective inputs (prompts) for generative AI models. It is not a cause of the performance gap between training and evaluation data. C. The model is biased. While an overfit model can exhibit bias, the core issue described is the failure to generalize, which is specifically termed overfitting. Bias refers to systematic errors or unfairness.

142. A company is building a chatbot to improve user experience. The company is using a large language model (LLM) from Amazon Bedrock for intent detection. The company wants to use few-shot learning to improve intent detection accuracy. Which additional data does the company need to meet these requirements?

A. Pairs of chatbot responses and correct user intents
B. Pairs of user messages and correct chatbot responses
C. Pairs of user messages and correct user intents
D. Pairs of user intents and correct chatbot responses

**Correct answer:** C. Pairs of user messages and correct user intents

Few-shot learning is a technique used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing a small number of examples (shots) within the prompt. For the task of intent detection, the goal is to correctly classify a user's intention based on their message. Therefore, the examples provided to the model must demonstrate this specific input-to-output mapping. The required data format is a set of pairs, where each pair consists of a sample user message (the input) and its corresponding correct user intent (the desired output). This allows the model to learn the pattern and accurately predict the intent for new, unseen user messages. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. This data links the system's output to the user's goal, which is useful for evaluating response appropriateness but not for training the initial intent detection from the user's message. B. This data is for training or evaluating a response generation model, which is a different task from intent detection. It maps what the user says to what the bot should say. D. This data is used for the dialogue management or response generation phase, which occurs after an intent has already been successfully identified. It maps a known intent to a system action.

A. Calculate the total cost of resources used by the model.
B. Measure the model's accuracy against a predefined benchmark dataset.
C. Count the number of layers in the neural network.
D. Assess the color accuracy of images processed by the model.

**Correct answer:** B. Measure the model's accuracy against a predefined benchmark dataset.

The standard methodology for evaluating the predictive accuracy of a machine learning model, including a foundation model for image classification, is to measure its performance against a benchmark dataset. This dataset, often referred to as a test or validation set, contains data (images) with known, ground-truth labels. The model's predictions are compared against these true labels to compute various performance metrics, with accuracy being one of the most common. This process provides an objective and quantifiable measure of how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data, which is the core purpose of evaluation. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Calculate the total cost of resources used by the model. This measures computational efficiency and operational cost, not the correctness or predictive power of the model's classifications. C. Count the number of layers in the neural network. This describes the model's architecture and complexity (depth). It is a characteristic of the model, not a method for evaluating its performance. D. Assess the color accuracy of images processed by the model. This is irrelevant for an image classification task, where the objective is to assign a correct category label, not to reproduce or evaluate image fidelity.

The dataset includes a target value that indicates whether a patient has heart disease. Which ML technique will meet these requirements?

A. Unsupervised learning
B. Supervised learning
C. Reinforcement learning
D. Semi-supervised learning

**Correct answer:** B. Supervised learning

The scenario describes a classic classification problem where the goal is to predict a specific outcome (heart disease risk) based on a dataset that includes both input features (patient data) and a known target value (the label indicating if a patient has heart disease). This process of training a model on a labeled dataset, where the correct answers are provided, is the definition of supervised learning. The model learns the relationship between the features and the labels to make predictions on new, unseen data. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Unsupervised learning: This approach is used with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures, such as clustering patients into groups, not for predicting a known target. C. Reinforcement learning: This involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a reward, which is not applicable to this prediction task. D. Semi-supervised learning: This method uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, but the problem explicitly describes a fully labeled dataset.

145. A company's large language model (LLM) is experiencing hallucinations. How can the company decrease hallucinations?

A. Set up Agents for Amazon Bedrock to supervise the model training.
B. Use data pre-processing and remove any data that causes hallucinations.
C. Decrease the temperature inference parameter for the model.
D. Use a foundation model (FM) that is trained to not hallucinate.

**Correct answer:** C. Decrease the temperature inference parameter for the model.

The temperature inference parameter directly controls the randomness of a large language model's (LLM) output. A higher temperature increases randomness, encouraging more creative but potentially less factual responses. Conversely, decreasing the temperature makes the model's output more deterministic and focused, causing it to select the most probable and often more factual tokens. This reduction in randomness is a primary and effective technique for mitigating model hallucinations, making the responses more grounded and reliable. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Agents for Amazon Bedrock are used to orchestrate and execute multi-step tasks by calling APIs at inference time; they do not supervise the model training process. B. Identifying specific data points that cause hallucinations is impractical. Hallucinations are an emergent property of the model, not a direct result of easily identifiable bad data. D. No foundation model (FM) is completely immune to hallucinations; it is an inherent challenge in current LLM technology. While some models are better, none are "trained to not hallucinate" entirely.

146. In which stage of the generative AI model lifecycle are tests performed to examine the model's accuracy?

A. Deployment
B. Data selection
C. Fine-tuning
D. Evaluation

**Correct answer:** D. Evaluation

The evaluation stage is the dedicated phase in the generative AI model lifecycle for systematically assessing the model's performance. During this stage, the model is tested against a holdout dataset (test set) that it has not previously seen. Key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are calculated to quantify the model's quality and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. This rigorous testing is essential to validate that the model meets business requirements and quality standards before it is approved for deployment. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Deployment is the operational stage where a validated model is integrated into a production environment for end-user consumption, which occurs after evaluation. B. Data selection is an initial stage focused on gathering and preparing the data for training. A model does not yet exist to be tested for accuracy. C. Fine-tuning is a training process where a pre-trained model is further trained on a specific dataset. Evaluation is the distinct, subsequent stage that measures the outcome of this process.

A. Retrain the model. Monitor model drift by using Amazon SageMaker Clarify.
B. Retrain the model. Monitor model drift by using Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor.
C. Build a new model. Monitor model drift by using Amazon SageMaker Feature Store.
D. Build a new model. Monitor model drift by using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart.

**Correct answer:** B. Retrain the model. Monitor model drift by using Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor.

The scenario describes model drift, where a model's predictive performance deteriorates over time due to changes in the production data's statistical properties. The solution requires two components: a mechanism to detect this drift and a strategy to correct it. Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor is the purpose-built service for this task. It automatically monitors machine learning models in production, detects deviations like data drift and model quality drift, and can be configured with Amazon CloudWatch to send notifications. Retraining the model on recent data is the standard and correct approach to update the model's patterns and mitigate the effects of drift, preventing the same issue from recurring with the same data patterns. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Amazon SageMaker Clarify is primarily for detecting statistical bias in data and explaining model predictions, not for continuous monitoring of data and model quality drift in production. C. Amazon SageMaker Feature Store is a repository for storing, sharing, and managing ML features. It does not have capabilities for monitoring the performance of a deployed model. D. Amazon SageMaker JumpStart is a hub for pre-trained models and solution templates to accelerate ML development. It is not a monitoring tool for models in production.

D. WaveNet

**Correct answer:** A. Generative adversarial network (GAN)

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks designed specifically for generative modeling. It consists of two neural networks, a Generator and a Discriminator, that compete with each other. The Generator's role is to create new, synthetic data instances that mimic the training data. The Discriminator's role is to evaluate these instances for authenticity. Through this adversarial process, the Generator becomes progressively better at producing realistic, synthetic data that captures the patterns and variations of the original dataset, directly fulfilling the company's requirement. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. XGBoost: This is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It predicts an outcome based on input features, but it does not generate new data samples. C. Residual neural network: This (ResNet) is a specific deep neural network architecture, primarily used for discriminative tasks like image classification. It is not a model type for generating synthetic data. D. WaveNet: This is a deep generative model, but it is highly specialized for generating raw audio waveforms.

A. Decrease the batch size.
B. Increase the epochs.
C. Decrease the epochs.
D. Increase the temperature parameter.

**Correct answer:** B. Increase the epochs.

An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset. By increasing the number of epochs, the model is exposed to the training data more times, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns more thoroughly. This iterative process of adjusting the model's weights helps to minimize the loss function and, consequently, increase the model's accuracy. Training is typically continued for more epochs until the model's performance on a validation set plateaus or reaches the desired acceptance level. This is a fundamental technique for improving a model that is currently underfitting. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Decrease the batch size: This can make training less stable and slower; it does not directly or reliably increase the final model accuracy. C. Decrease the epochs: This would reduce the model's training time, likely leading to underfitting and a decrease in accuracy, which is the opposite of the goal. D. Increase the temperature parameter: Temperature is a hyperparameter used during the inference/generation phase to control output randomness, not during training to improve model accuracy.

B. Run SageMaker training and inference by using network isolation.
C. Encrypt the data at rest by using encryption for SageMaker geospatial capabilities.
D. Associate appropriate AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with the SageMaker jobs.

**Correct answer:** B. Run SageMaker training and inference by using network isolation.

Amazon SageMaker provides a network isolation feature specifically for training jobs and inference endpoints. When enabled, SageMaker prevents the underlying containers from initiating any outbound network connections to the public internet. This is achieved by launching the resources in a private Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without an internet gateway. To access other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, SageMaker uses VPC endpoints, ensuring all traffic remains within the AWS network. This configuration directly meets the regulatory requirement for running jobs in an isolated environment without internet access. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. SageMaker Experiments is a feature for organizing, tracking, comparing, and evaluating machine learning experiments and model versions. It does not provide network isolation capabilities. C. Encrypting data at rest is a crucial security measure for protecting stored data, but it does not address the requirement of network isolation or prevent internet access during job execution. D. AWS IAM roles are used to manage permissions and grant SageMaker jobs the necessary access to other AWS resources (like S3 buckets). They control what a job can access, not how it connects.

Which prompt engineering technique is the AI practitioner using?

A. Chain-of-thought prompting
B. Prompt injection
C. Few-shot prompting
D. Prompt templating

**Correct answer:** A. Chain-of-thought prompting

The technique of explicitly instructing a model to "show its work by explaining its reasoning step by step" is the definition of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. This method encourages the large language model (LLM) to break down a complex problem, such as a numerical reasoning challenge, into a series of intermediate, sequential steps. By verbalizing its reasoning process, the model is more likely to arrive at a correct final answer, as it mimics a more deliberate and logical thought process. This is a standard technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of models like Amazon Titan. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Prompt injection: This is a security exploit where malicious instructions are inserted into a prompt to hijack the model's output, not a technique for improving reasoning. C. Few-shot prompting: This involves providing several examples (shots) of the desired input and output in the prompt to guide the model, which is not what the practitioner is doing. D.

A. Increase the number of epochs.
B. Use transfer learning.
C. Decrease the number of epochs.
D. Use unsupervised learning.

**Correct answer:** B. Use transfer learning.

Transfer learning is a machine learning strategy where a model developed for a specific task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second, related task. This approach leverages the knowledge (features, weights, and patterns) gained from the initial training. It is highly effective for adapting pre-trained models to new, domain-specific tasks without the need to build and train a new model from scratch, which directly addresses the company's requirements for efficiency and model adaptation. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Increasing the number of epochs is a hyperparameter tuning technique to extend the training process on a given dataset, not a strategy for adapting a model to a new task. C. Decreasing the number of epochs is a hyperparameter adjustment, often used to prevent overfitting, but it is not the method for repurposing a pre-trained model for a new problem. D.

A. Reduce the volume of data that is used in training.
B. Add hyperparameters to the model.
C. Increase the volume of data that is used in training.
D. Increase the model training time.

**Correct answer:** C. Increase the volume of data that is used in training.

The scenario described, where a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data (in production), is a classic example of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and specific patterns, and fails to generalize to unseen data. The most effective and fundamental way to combat overfitting is to train the model on a larger, more diverse dataset. More data helps the model learn the true underlying patterns and reduces its tendency to memorize the training set, thereby improving its generalization and production performance. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Reducing the volume of data that is used in training would likely worsen overfitting, as the model has fewer examples from which to learn generalizable patterns. B. Simply adding hyperparameters does not solve overfitting. While tuning hyperparameters (e.g., increasing regularization) can help, adding more complexity can increase the risk of overfitting. D. Increasing the model training time, without controls like early stopping, typically exacerbates overfitting by giving the model more opportunity to memorize the training data.

**Correct answer:** A. Model precision and recall.

The F1 score is a standard metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, which is a common application of foundation models. It is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model, indicating its accuracy when it predicts a positive class. Recall (also known as sensitivity) measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the model. The F1 score combines these two metrics into a single value, providing a balanced assessment of a model's performance, especially in cases where there is an uneven class distribution. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Model speed is an operational performance metric measured by latency or throughput, not by the F1 score, which evaluates classification accuracy. C. The financial cost is an economic metric related to the resources consumed during training and inference, completely separate from model accuracy metrics like F1. D. Energy efficiency is a sustainability and operational metric that measures the computational power consumed, which is unrelated to the F1 score's purpose of measuring predictive accuracy.

A. Decrease the temperature value
B. Increase the temperature value
C. Decrease the length of output tokens
D. Increase the maximum generation length

**Correct answer:** A. Decrease the temperature value

The temperature inference parameter controls the randomness of the model's output. A lower temperature value, closer to 0, makes the model more deterministic by increasing the probability of selecting the most likely next token. This results in responses that are more focused, predictable, and consistent for the same input prompt. For a task like sentiment analysis where consistency is key, decreasing the temperature is the correct approach to ensure the model reliably produces the same or very similar outputs. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Increasing the temperature value introduces more randomness, leading to more creative but less consistent and predictable responses. C. Decreasing the length of output tokens only shortens the response; it does not influence the consistency of the generated content. D. Increasing the maximum generation length allows for a longer response but has no effect on the determinism or consistency of the output.

C. Create an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base
D. Enable model invocation logging

**Correct answer:** C. Create an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base

The requirement is to supplement a foundation model (FM) with private company data. This is achieved through a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Amazon Bedrock provides a fully managed RAG capability through its "Knowledge bases" feature. A knowledge base connects to your private data sources (e.g., documents in Amazon S3), automatically ingests and converts the data into vector embeddings, and stores them in a vector database. When a query is made, the knowledge base retrieves the most relevant information from your data and provides it as context to the FM, enabling it to generate more accurate and context-specific responses based on your private information. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Using a different FM does not solve the fundamental problem of connecting the model to private data sources; any FM would require a mechanism like RAG to access this data. B. Choosing a lower temperature value only makes the model's output more deterministic and less creative; it does not provide the model with access to new information. D.

Services like Amazon SageMaker Clarify are specifically designed to provide tools for model explainability, helping users understand feature importance and how the model behaves for individual or groups of predictions. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Model training: This is the process of building a model by feeding it data, not the process of understanding its subsequent predictions. C. Model interoperability: This refers to the ability of different systems or software to exchange and make use of information, not the internal logic of a model. D. Model performance: This measures a model's effectiveness using metrics like accuracy or precision, but it does not explain the reasoning behind its predictions.

161. A company has documents that are missing some words because of a database error. The company wants to build an ML model that can suggest potential words to fill in the missing text. Which type of model meets this requirement?

A. Topic modeling
B. Clustering models
C. Prescriptive ML models
D. BERT-based models

**Correct answer:** D. BERT-based models

The task described is known as masked language modeling (MLM) or text in-filling, where a model must predict missing words based on the surrounding context. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and its variants are specifically designed for this. During their pre-training phase, these models learn to predict randomly masked words in a text by considering the context from both the left and the right (bidirectionally). This makes them exceptionally well-suited for suggesting words to fill in missing text, as required by the company. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Topic modeling: This technique identifies abstract topics or themes within a collection of documents, not predict specific missing words in a sentence. B. Clustering models: These are unsupervised models that group similar data points (like entire documents) together but do not have the capability to predict missing words. C. Prescriptive ML models: This is a broad functional category of ML that recommends actions, not a specific model architecture. BERT is a type of model; prescriptive is what it might be used for.

162. Which technique involves training AI models on labeled datasets to adapt the models to specific industry terminology and requirements?

A. Data augmentation
B. Fine-tuning
C. Model quantization
D. Continuous pre-training

**Correct answer:** B. Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning is a transfer learning technique where a pre-trained model, often a large foundation model, is further trained on a smaller, domain-specific, labeled dataset. This process adjusts the model's weights and parameters to adapt its knowledge and capabilities to the nuances of a specific task or industry. By using labeled examples relevant to the target domain (e.g., medical, legal, or financial terminology), fine-tuning enhances the model's accuracy and performance on specialized requirements beyond its original general-purpose training. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Data augmentation artificially increases the size of a training dataset by creating modified versions of existing data. It improves model generalization but does not adapt a pre-trained model to new terminology. C. Model quantization is an optimization process that reduces the precision of a model's weights (e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit floats) to decrease its size and improve inference speed, not for domain adaptation. D. Continuous pre-training adapts a model to a new domain's vocabulary and style using a large corpus of unlabeled data, whereas the question specifically mentions using labeled datasets for specific requirements.

163. A company is using few-shot prompting on a base model that is hosted on Amazon Bedrock. The model currently uses 10 examples in the prompt. The model is invoked once daily and is performing well. The company wants to lower the monthly cost. Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Customize the model by using fine-tuning.
B. Decrease the number of tokens in the prompt.
C. Increase the number of tokens in the prompt.
D. Use Provisioned Throughput.

**Correct answer:** B. Decrease the number of tokens in the prompt.

Amazon Bedrock's On-Demand pricing model charges based on the volume of data processed, specifically the number of input and output tokens. In a few-shot prompting scenario, the examples provided within the prompt constitute a significant portion of the input tokens. By decreasing the number of examples from 10 to a smaller number, the total count of input tokens per invocation is reduced. Since the model is invoked daily, this directly translates to a lower daily and, consequently, lower monthly cost. This is the most direct and effective cost-saving measure for a low-frequency workload. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Customize the model by using fine-tuning. Fine-tuning incurs separate costs for training and for hosting the custom model, which is not cost-effective for a workload that runs only once per day. C. Increase the number of tokens in the prompt. This would increase the cost of each invocation because the On-Demand pricing model is directly proportional to the number of tokens processed. D. Use Provisioned Throughput. Provisioned Throughput is a pricing model designed for high-volume, consistent workloads. For a once-daily invocation, it would be significantly more expensive than the pay-as-you-go On-Demand model.

164. Why does overfilting occur in ML models?

A. The training dataset does not reptesent all possible input values.
B. The model contains a regularization method.
C. The model training stops early because of an early stopping criterion.
D. The training dataset contains too many features.

**Correct answer:** D. The training dataset contains too many features.

Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including its noise and random fluctuations, instead of the underlying general pattern. This results in high accuracy on the training data but poor performance on new, unseen data. A primary cause of this is excessive model complexity relative to the amount of training data. When a training dataset contains too many features (high dimensionality), the model has more flexibility to create a complex decision boundary that perfectly fits the training examples, including the noise. This phenomenon is often referred to as the "curse of dimensionality." Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. A non-representative dataset leads to a biased model that cannot generalize well, but overfitting specifically refers to the model's complexity causing it to memorize noise in the training data it was given. B. Regularization is a technique explicitly used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty for model complexity, encouraging simpler models that generalize better. C. Early stopping is a form of regularization used to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process before the model begins to learn the noise in the training data.

165. A company has built an image classification model to predict plant diseases from photos of plant leaves. The company wants to evaluate how many images the model classified correctly. Which evaluation metric should the company use to measure the model's performance?

A. R-squared score
B. Accuracy
C. Root mean squared error (RMSE)
D. Learning rate

**Correct answer:** B. Accuracy

The problem describes an image classification task, where the model assigns a categorical label (a specific plant disease) to an input (an image). The company wants to measure the proportion of correct classifications. Accuracy is the most suitable metric for this purpose, as it is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions. It directly quantifies how often the model classifies images correctly, aligning perfectly with the company's requirement. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. R-squared score: This metric evaluates the performance of regression models, which predict continuous numerical values, not discrete classes like plant diseases. C. Root mean squared error (RMSE): This is also a metric for regression models. It measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual continuous values. D. Learning rate: This is a hyperparameter used during the training process to control the step size of model updates. It is not a metric for evaluating a trained model's performance.

166. Which technique breaks a complex task into smaller subtasks that are sent sequentially to a large language model (LLM)?

A. One-shot prompting
B. Prompt chaining
C. Tree of thoughts
D. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Correct answer:** B. Prompt chaining

Prompt chaining is a technique where a complex problem is broken down into smaller, manageable subtasks. Each subtask is addressed by a separate prompt to a large language model (LLM). The output of the first prompt is then used as part of the input for the second prompt, and this process continues sequentially. This creates a "chain" of interactions, allowing the LLM to build upon previous results to solve multi-step problems that would be too complex to handle in a single prompt. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. One-shot prompting provides a single example within a prompt to guide the model's response for a task, but it does not involve a sequence of multiple prompts. C. Tree of thoughts is a more complex method that explores multiple different reasoning paths (branches) for a problem, rather than following a single sequential chain of subtasks. D. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances an LLM's knowledge by first retrieving relevant data from an external source and then using it to generate a response, not by breaking the task itself into sequential steps.

167. A company is monitoring a predictive model by using Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor. The company notices data drift beyond a defined threshold. The company wants to mitigate a potentially adverse impact on the predictive model.

A. Restart the SageMaker AI endpoint.
B. Adjust the monitoring sensitivity.
C. Re-train the model with fresh data.
D. Set up experiments tracking.

**Correct answer:** C. Re-train the model with fresh data.

Data drift occurs when the statistical properties of the live inference data diverge significantly from the data the model was trained on. This divergence, also known as concept drift, degrades the model's predictive accuracy because its learned patterns are no longer representative of the new data. The standard and most effective mitigation strategy is to re-train the model using a fresh dataset that includes the recent, drifted data. This allows the model to learn the new patterns and distributions, thereby restoring its performance and ensuring its continued relevance and accuracy. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Restarting the SageMaker AI endpoint only reloads the existing, outdated model. It does not update the model's learned parameters to account for the data drift. B. Adjusting the monitoring sensitivity only changes the threshold for triggering an alert. This action ignores the underlying problem of performance degradation and does not mitigate its impact. D. Setting up experiments tracking with Amazon SageMaker Experiments is a best practice for organizing and comparing training runs, but it is not the direct action to fix the model's performance issue caused by data drift.

A. Decision trees
B. Linear regression
C. Logistic regression
D. Neural networks

**Correct answer:** A. Decision trees

The problem requires a multi-class classification algorithm that is highly interpretable, allowing the company to "document how the inner mechanism of the model affects the output." Decision trees are inherently transparent or "white-box" models. They create a flowchart-like structure of if-then-else rules based on the input features. This entire decision-making path, from the root to the final leaf node (the predicted category), can be easily visualized and documented. This directly fulfills the requirement for an explainable model where the internal logic is clear and can be audited. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Linear regression: This is a regression algorithm used for predicting continuous numerical outcomes, not for classifying data into a set of discrete categories like gene types. C. Logistic regression: While a classification algorithm, it is primarily designed for binary (two-class) problems and is less directly interpretable in its step-by-step logic compared to the visual path of a decision tree. D. Neural networks: These are considered "black-box" models. Their complex architecture with many layers and neurons makes it extremely difficult to understand and document the specific reasoning behind a prediction.

A. Temperature
B. Context window
C. Batch size
D. Model size

**Correct answer:** B. Context window

The context window refers to the maximum number of tokens (which can be words, parts of words, or characters) that a large language model (LLM) can process at one time. This includes both the user's input prompt and the model's generated response. Therefore, the size of the context window directly determines how much information, such as a lengthy customer review for sentiment analysis, can be submitted in a single prompt. Different models available through Amazon Bedrock have different context window sizes, making this the critical consideration for the company's question. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Temperature is an inference parameter that controls the randomness and creativity of the model's output, not the amount of input it can process. C. Batch size refers to the number of separate prompts processed in parallel during inference, which improves throughput but does not affect the size of a single prompt. D. Model size, measured in parameters, relates to the model's overall complexity and capability but is not the direct measure of its input length capacity.

A. Supervised learning
B. Hyperparameter tuning
C. Regularization techniques
D. Transfer learning

**Correct answer:** D. Transfer learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model pre-trained on a large dataset for one task is repurposed or fine-tuned for a second, related task. By starting with the knowledge (weights and features) learned from the initial task, the model can achieve higher performance on the new task more quickly and with less data than training a model from scratch. This directly matches the requirement to use information produced from previous tasks to increase the learning speed of the new model. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Supervised learning is a broad category of ML that requires labeled data; it does not inherently involve reusing knowledge from prior tasks. B. Hyperparameter tuning is the process of optimizing model configuration settings (like learning rate), not leveraging knowledge from other tasks to speed up learning. C. Regularization techniques are used to prevent model overfitting by adding a penalty for complexity, which is unrelated to leveraging prior knowledge.

A. Batch transform
B. Real-time inference
C. Serverless inference
D. Asynchronous inference

**Correct answer:** A. Batch transform

Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform is the ideal solution for this scenario. It is specifically designed for high-throughput, offline inference on large datasets where low latency is not a requirement. This feature allows the company to run predictions on their entire multi-GB archived datasets in a single job, making it cost-effective and efficient for bulk data processing. The model predictions are stored in a specified S3 location for later analysis, which aligns with the requirement that immediate access is not needed. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Real-time inference: This is for low-latency, persistent endpoints that serve individual prediction requests, which is unnecessary and costly for processing large, archived datasets where immediate results are not required. C. Serverless inference: This is a type of real-time inference for workloads with intermittent traffic. It is not designed for processing entire multi-GB datasets in a single batch job. D. Asynchronous inference: This is for handling large individual prediction requests (up to 1 GB) with long processing times, not for processing an entire multi-GB dataset in a single operation.

A. Use deep learning to perform hyperparameter tuning.
B. Collect user reviews and label each review as positive or negative.
C. Continuously monitor outputs in production.
D. Perform feature engineering on the input dataset.

**Correct answer:** C. Continuously monitor outputs in production.

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. A fundamental principle of MLOps is the continuous monitoring of a model's performance after it has been deployed. This is essential because model performance can degrade over time due to phenomena like data drift (the statistical properties of the input data change) or concept drift (the relationship between input and output variables changes). Continuously monitoring the model's outputs helps detect these issues early, ensuring the model remains accurate and triggering retraining or other interventions when necessary. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Hyperparameter tuning is a model optimization step performed during the training or fine-tuning phase, not a continuous operational practice for a model already in production. B. Collecting and labeling data is a prerequisite for training or retraining a model. While part of the overall lifecycle, continuous monitoring is the key MLOps practice for a running model. D. Feature engineering is a data preprocessing step that occurs before model training. It is part of the model development phase, not the operational monitoring phase.

A. Evaluate the models by using built-in prompt datasets.
B. Evaluate the models by using a human workforce and custom prompt datasets.
C. Use public model leaderboards to identify the model.
D. Use the model InvocationLatency runtime metrics in Amazon CloudWatch when trying models.

**Correct answer:** B. Evaluate the models by using a human workforce and custom prompt datasets.

The core requirement is to select a model based on a preferred "style," which is a subjective human judgment. Amazon Bedrock's model evaluation capabilities are designed for this purpose. The most effective method is to use a human workforce, in this case, the company's own employees, to review and rate the responses from different models. This evaluation should be conducted using custom prompt datasets that reflect the company's actual internal use cases. This approach directly measures which model's output aligns best with the employees' preferences for style and tone, ensuring the chosen model meets the specific requirements. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Built-in datasets are for evaluating models on general, objective metrics like accuracy or toxicity, not for a company's specific stylistic preference. C. Public model leaderboards rank models on standardized, generic benchmarks and do not reflect the unique stylistic needs or preferences of a specific company. D. InvocationLatency is a performance metric that measures the speed of a model's response, not the quality, content, or style of the generated text.

A. Encrypt each document with encryption keys.
B. Create embeddings from document chunks.
C. Label the document data with metadata.
D. Generate one-hot encoding for each document.

**Correct answer:** B. Create embeddings from document chunks.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works by first retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and then providing that information as context to a large language model (LLM) to generate an answer. To make the documents searchable based on semantic meaning, they must be converted into a numerical format called embeddings. The process involves splitting documents into smaller chunks, using an embedding model to create a vector representation (embedding) for each chunk, and storing these vectors in a vector database for efficient similarity search and retrieval. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Encrypting documents is a security measure. It does not prepare the content for semantic search and retrieval by the RAG system. C. Labeling data with metadata is useful for filtering but is not the core mechanism for enabling semantic retrieval of the document's content itself. D. One-hot encoding is unsuitable for representing the complex semantic meaning of text chunks; it is used for categorical data with a limited vocabulary.

A. Real-time inference
B. Serverless inference
C. Asynchronous inference
D. Batch transform

**Correct answer:** C. Asynchronous inference

Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous Inference is specifically designed for scenarios with large input payloads and long processing times. It can handle payloads up to 1 GB and processing times up to one hour. When a request is made, SageMaker queues it, returns an immediate acknowledgment with an output location, and processes the inference in the background. Upon completion, the result is placed in the specified Amazon S3 location, and an optional Amazon SNS notification can be sent. This model is ideal for workloads that do not require immediate, sub-second latency but need a response for a long-running task as soon as it is available, fitting the "near real-time" requirement for this context. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Real-time inference: This option is designed for low-latency (millisecond) responses and has a maximum processing timeout of 60 seconds and a much smaller payload size limit, making it unsuitable. B. Serverless inference: Similar to real-time inference, this is for workloads with low latency requirements and has a 60-second processing timeout and small payload limits, which are not met by the scenario. D. Batch transform: This is used for offline processing of an entire dataset at once, not for individual, on-demand inference requests. It is not a "near real-time" solution.

A. Adjust the prompt.
B. Choose an LLM of a different size.
C. Increase the temperature.
D. Increase the Top K value.

**Correct answer:** A. Adjust the prompt.

Prompt engineering is the most direct and effective method for controlling the output of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). By providing clear and specific instructions within the prompt, a user can guide the model to generate responses that adhere to desired constraints. In this scenario, the prompt can be explicitly crafted to request a short response in a specific language (e.g., "Provide a one-sentence product recommendation in French."). This technique directly aligns the model's output with the company's formatting and language requirements without altering the model's core architecture or its generation parameters for randomness. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Choose an LLM of a different size: Model size affects general capabilities, cost, and latency, but it does not directly control specific output characteristics like length or language. C. Increase the temperature: Increasing the temperature parameter makes the model's output more random and creative, which is contrary to the goal of producing a constrained and specific response. D. Increase the Top K value: Increasing the Top K value allows the model to consider a wider, more diverse set of potential next words, which increases randomness rather than enforcing specific formatting rules.

The foundation model (FM) is underperforming due to a knowledge gap related to a specific, complex domain (scientific research). This requires adapting the model to the new vocabulary and concepts. Domain adaptation through fine-tuning is the most effective method for this purpose. By fine-tuning the base FM with a curated dataset of the research papers, the model's weights are adjusted to learn the specialized terminology, its context, and relationships. This fundamentally enhances the model's ability to comprehend and reason about the specific scientific content, directly addressing the root cause of the poor performance where prompt engineering failed. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. The question states that multiple prompt engineering attempts have already failed; few-shot prompting is a prompt engineering technique and is insufficient for teaching a deep, specialized vocabulary. C. Changing inference parameters (like temperature or top-p) only modifies the characteristics of the generated output (e.g., its randomness or creativity), not the model's core understanding of the input data. D. Removing complex scientific terms from the data would corrupt the source of information, making it impossible for the chatbot to answer questions about the research accurately.

184. What is the purpose of vector embeddings in a large language model (LLM)?

A. Splitting text into manageable pieces of data
B. Grouping a set of characters to be treated as a single unit
C. Providing the ability to mathematically compare texts
D. Providing the count of every word in the input

**Correct answer:** C. Providing the ability to mathematically compare texts

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or other data in a multi-dimensional space. The primary purpose of this representation in a large language model (LLM) is to capture the semantic meaning and context of the input. By converting text into vectors (arrays of numbers), the model can perform mathematical operations, such as calculating the cosine similarity or Euclidean distance between them. This allows the model to quantitatively measure the semantic relatedness of different pieces of text, which is fundamental for tasks like semantic search, text classification, and clustering. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Splitting text into manageable pieces of data is called tokenization, which is a preprocessing step that occurs before embedding. B. Grouping a set of characters to be treated as a single unit defines a token, the output of the tokenization process. D. Providing the count of every word in the input describes a simpler text representation method like a bag-of-words model, which lacks the semantic context captured by embeddings.

185. A company has fine-tuned an Amazon Bedrock foundation model (FM) to produce short document summaries. The company wants an automated metric that compares each model-generated summary with its human-written reference summary. Which metric will meet these requirements?

A. F1 score
B. Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)
C. Perplexity
D. Frechet Inception Distance (FID)

**Correct answer:** B. Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)

The Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) is a set of metrics specifically designed to automatically evaluate text summarization and machine translation. It works by comparing a model-generated summary to one or more human-created reference summaries. ROUGE metrics, such as ROUGE-N (n-gram overlap) and ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence), quantify the quality of the summary based on lexical overlap, making it the ideal automated metric for this scenario. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. The F1 score is a standard metric for classification tasks, measuring a model's accuracy by combining precision and recall. It is not used for text summarization. C. Perplexity measures how well a language model predicts a sequence of text. While it evaluates model fluency, it does not directly compare a generated summary to a reference summary. D. Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is a metric used to evaluate the quality of images generated by models like GANs, not text.

186. Which metric measures the runtime efficiency of operating AI models?

A. Customer satisfaction score (CSAT)
B. Training time for each epoch
C. Average response time
D. Number of training instances

**Correct answer:** C. Average response time

Runtime efficiency measures the performance of a deployed AI model during inference, which is its operational phase. Average response time, also known as latency, is a direct and critical metric for this purpose. It quantifies the time elapsed from when the model receives an input request to when it returns a prediction. A lower average response time indicates higher runtime efficiency, which is crucial for user-facing applications where speed is essential. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Customer satisfaction score (CSAT): This is a business metric that measures user experience. While poor model efficiency can negatively impact CSAT, it does not directly measure the model's technical runtime performance. B. Training time for each epoch: This metric evaluates the efficiency of the model training process, not its performance during runtime operation after deployment. D. Number of training instances: This describes the size of the dataset used to train the model. It is an input to the training process, not a metric for operational efficiency.

188. Which option is a benefit of ongoing pre-training when fine-tuning a foundation model (FM)?

A. Helps decrease the model's complexity
B. Improves model performance over time
C. Decreases the training time requirement
D. Optimizes model inference time

**Correct answer:** B. Improves model performance over time

Ongoing pre-training, also known as continued pre-training or domain adaptation, is the process of further training a foundation model on a large corpus of unlabeled, domain-specific data (e.g., medical literature, financial reports). This step occurs before task-specific fine-tuning. Its primary benefit is to adapt the model's general knowledge to the specific vocabulary, nuances, and context of the target domain. This adaptation results in a model that performs more accurately and effectively on downstream tasks within that domain, thereby improving its performance over time as it incorporates more relevant data. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Helps decrease the model's complexity: Ongoing pre-training updates the model's weights but does not alter its underlying architecture or reduce its number of parameters, so complexity remains unchanged. C. Decreases the training time requirement: This process adds a significant training step, increasing the overall compute time, even if it might slightly reduce the time needed for the final fine-tuning phase. D. Optimizes model inference time: Inference time is primarily determined by the model's size and architecture. Updating the model's weights through continued training does not inherently make it faster at generating predictions. ---

A. Regression
B. Classification
C. Clustering
D. Reinforcement learning

**Correct answer:** C. Clustering

The problem describes a scenario where the goal is to discover natural groupings or segments within an unlabeled dataset. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique specifically designed for this purpose. It groups data points based on their inherent similarities across various features (demographics, purchase history, etc.). This allows the company to identify distinct customer personas without prior knowledge of the group definitions. The key indicators are the desire to "group" the customer base and the use of an "unlabeled dataset." Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Regression is a supervised learning technique used to predict a continuous numerical value, not to group data points. B. Classification is a supervised learning technique that assigns data points to predefined categories, which requires a labeled dataset. D. Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a reward, which is not applicable here.

A. Multi-modal embedding model
B. Text embedding model
C. Multi-modal generation model
D. Image generation model

**Correct answer:** A. Multi-modal embedding model

The requirement is to build a search application that handles queries containing both text and images. This is a multi-modal use case. A multi-modal embedding model is specifically designed to process inputs from different modalities (like text and images) and convert them into a single, unified numerical vector, or "embedding." This embedding captures the combined semantic meaning of the query. The application can then perform a similarity search by comparing this query embedding against a pre-computed database of embeddings for the items being searched, enabling accurate and context-aware results. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A text embedding model cannot process the image component of the query, making it unsuitable for the multi-modal requirement. A multi-modal generation model is designed to create new content (e.g., an image from a text description), not to produce embeddings optimized for search and retrieval tasks. An image generation model's purpose is to create new images; it cannot process the text part of the query or generate representations for a search application.

D. Evaluation

**Correct answer:** A. Fine-tuning

The scenario describes fine-tuning, a critical step in the foundation model (FM) lifecycle. Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained foundation model and adapting it for a specific, downstream task. This is achieved by continuing the training process using a smaller, labeled dataset that is highly relevant to the target application. This supervised learning approach specializes the model's general capabilities, acquired during pre-training, to improve its performance on the specific task. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Data selection: This is a preparatory activity for training or fine-tuning, involving the curation of datasets, not the training step itself. C. Pre-training: This is the initial, computationally intensive phase where an FM is trained on a massive, broad, and often unlabeled dataset to learn general patterns. D. Evaluation: This step occurs after training or fine-tuning to measure the model's performance against specific metrics and benchmarks, not the training process itself.

A. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)
B. Root mean squared error (RMSE)
C. Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)
D. F1 score

**Correct answer:** A. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)

Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) is a standard and widely used metric for evaluating the quality of text generated by machine translation systems. It works by comparing the machine-generated translation to one or more high-quality human reference translations. The core idea is to measure the correspondence between the machine's output and the human's by calculating the precision of n-grams (contiguous sequences of words). A higher BLEU score indicates a closer match to the reference translations, signifying better accuracy and fluency. This directly addresses the company's need to evaluate the accuracy of its translated manuals. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Root mean squared error (RMSE): This metric is used for regression tasks to measure the difference between predicted and actual numerical values, not for evaluating the quality of generated text. C. Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE): While related to BLEU, ROUGE is primarily designed for evaluating automatic text summarization by focusing on recall (n-gram overlap from the reference in the summary). D. F1 score: This metric is used for classification tasks. It calculates the harmonic mean of precision and recall to evaluate a model's accuracy in categorizing data, not for assessing generated text quality.

This method is automated, repeatable, and eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming human review, making it ideal for scalable model comparison on complex, subjective attributes. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. String matching is too rigid and cannot evaluate semantic meaning, helpfulness, or tone; it only checks for exact text overlap. B. ROUGE measures n-gram overlap against a reference text, making it suitable for summarization tasks but not for nuanced conversational evaluation. D. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architectural pattern to enhance LLM responses with external data, not an evaluation technique.

B. Increase the model's complexity by adding more layers to the model's architecture.
C. Create effective prompts that provide clear instructions and context to guide the model's generation.
D. Select a large, diverse dataset to pre-train a new generative model.

**Correct answer:** C. Create effective prompts that provide clear instructions and context to guide the model's generation.

The most direct and effective method to guide a pre-trained generative AI model to produce content with a specific brand voice is through prompt engineering. By crafting clear prompts that provide specific instructions, context, and examples (a technique known as few-shot prompting), the company can steer the model's output to align with its messaging requirements. This approach leverages the model's existing capabilities without requiring complex and costly modifications to its architecture or retraining. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Optimizing architecture or hyperparameters is part of model fine-tuning or training, a more involved process than is necessary for guiding output for a specific task. B. Increasing model complexity by adding layers is a fundamental architectural change, not a method for controlling the stylistic output of an already trained model. D.

B. Use batch inferencing to process detailed responses.
C. Experiment and refine the prompt until the FM produces the desired responses.
D. Define a higher number for the temperature parameter.

**Correct answer:** C. Experiment and refine the prompt until the FM produces the desired responses.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the input (prompt) given to a foundation model (FM) to guide its output. To ensure the chatbot's responses adhere to a specific company tone, the most effective method among the choices is to iteratively experiment with and refine the prompt. This involves providing clear instructions, context, and examples (few-shot prompting) within the prompt itself to steer the model's persona, style, and tone to match the company's requirements. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Setting a low token limit controls the length of the response, not its tone. This could prematurely cut off helpful technical information. B. Batch inferencing is a method for processing multiple inputs simultaneously for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, not for controlling the content or style of individual responses. D. A higher temperature parameter increases the randomness and creativity of the FM's output, which would likely make the tone less consistent and controlled, contrary to the requirement.

D. Provide the new text passage with a few examples of unrelated tasks, such as text summarization or question answering.

**Correct answer:** A. Provide examples of text passages with corresponding positive or negative labels in the prompt followed by the new text passage to be classified.

This strategy is known as few-shot prompting. By providing the large language model (LLM) with a few examples (shots) of text passages and their corresponding sentiment labels, the prompt sets a clear context and demonstrates the desired task and output format. This technique, also called in-context learning, allows the model to recognize the pattern for sentiment classification without requiring fine-tuning. It is a highly effective and standard prompt engineering method for improving the accuracy and reliability of classification tasks in services like Amazon Bedrock. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B: Providing a theoretical explanation is less effective than concrete examples for guiding a model to perform a specific, practical task like classification. C: This is zero-shot prompting. While potentially functional, it is generally less accurate and consistent than few-shot prompting for specific classification tasks.

A. Linear regression
B. Classification
C. Decision tree
D. Autoencoders

**Correct answer:** D. Autoencoders

The problem requires a machine learning method to detect abnormal patterns (anomaly detection) using unlabeled data. This scenario necessitates an unsupervised learning approach. Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. They are trained to reconstruct their input data by first compressing it into a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and then decompressing it back to the original dimension (decoding). When trained on normal data, the model learns the underlying patterns. An abnormal data point will result in a high reconstruction error, which can be used to flag it as an anomaly. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Linear regression: This is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous value. It requires labeled data with known outcomes, which is not available in this scenario. B. Classification: This is a supervised learning technique used to assign a categorical label. It requires pre-labeled data (e.g., "normal" or "abnormal") for training, which the company lacks. C.

- Prompt a model to break down the step-by-step process that the model took to arrive at a final answer
- Prompt a model to perform a task without providing examples

**Term Bank:**
- Few-shot prompting
- Chain-of-thought prompting

**Correct answer:** Provide a small number of examples to the model to understand the desired task before generating outputs → Few-shot prompting | Prompt a model to break down the step-by-step process that the model took to arrive at a final answer → Chain-of-thought prompting | Prompt a model to perform a task without providing examples → Zero-shot prompting

As technical examiners, we define these prompt engineering techniques strictly by how we structure the context for foundation models. In zero-shot prompting, we present the task directly with no prior examples. In few-shot prompting, we provide a limited number of input-output examples in the prompt context to demonstrate the expected pattern or format before asking the model to complete the task. For chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, we explicitly instruct the model to output its intermediate step-by-step reasoning process, which significantly improves its ability to resolve complex logic or math problems before arriving at the final answer.

A. Create a new labeled dataset
B. Perform feature engineering.
C. Adjust the prompt template.
D. Fine-tune the LLM.

**Correct answer:** C. Adjust the prompt template.

When transitioning between different large language models (LLMs), even on a unified platform like Amazon Bedrock, the most critical and immediate step is to adapt the prompts. Different LLMs are trained by different providers on varied datasets and with distinct architectures, causing them to respond differently to the same input. The structure, phrasing, and instructions within a prompt (the prompt template) that are optimal for one model may be suboptimal for another. Therefore, adjusting the prompt template is essential to ensure the new model understands the context and constraints of the information extraction task to achieve the desired performance. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Create a new labeled dataset: This is incorrect because creating a labeled dataset is a prerequisite for fine-tuning a model, not for using a pre-trained base model. The company can start using the new LLM with prompting alone. B. Perform feature engineering: This is incorrect as feature engineering is a concept from traditional machine learning. Modern LLMs are designed to process raw text directly, largely eliminating the need for manual feature creation. D.

A. Temperature
B. Batch size
C. Learning rate
D. Optimizer type

**Correct answer:** A. Temperature

Temperature is an inference hyperparameter that controls the randomness of a large language model's (LLM) output. It adjusts the probability distribution of the potential next words (tokens) the model can choose. A higher temperature value (e.g., 0.7) makes the distribution flatter, increasing the chance of selecting less likely words and thus producing more diverse, creative, and novel text. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.3) makes the model more confident and deterministic, favoring the most probable words. To increase output diversity, the company should increase the temperature. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Batch size: This is a training hyperparameter defining the number of samples used in one iteration to update the model's weights; it does not control output diversity during inference. C. Learning rate: This is a training hyperparameter that controls the step size of weight updates during the optimization process; it has no role in generating output post-training. D. Optimizer type: This refers to the algorithm (e.g., Adam, SGD) used to minimize the loss function during model training, not a parameter for controlling text generation at inference time.

Which ML model type meets these requirements?

A. Logistic regression model
B. Deep learning model built on principal components
C. K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) model
D. Neural network

**Correct answer:** A. Logistic regression model

The core requirement is for a model where employees can view and adjust the weights assigned to different variables. Logistic regression is an ideal choice because it is a highly interpretable linear model. The model's output is a weighted sum of the input features, and these weights (coefficients) directly and clearly represent the influence of each variable on the prediction. A positive weight increases the likelihood of the outcome, while a negative one decreases it. This transparency allows domain experts to easily understand, validate, and adjust the model's logic based on their expertise. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Deep learning model built on principal components: Deep learning models are inherently complex and not easily interpretable ("black box"). Using principal components further abstracts the original features, making it impossible to adjust weights for specific business variables. C. K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) model: This is an instance-based algorithm that makes predictions based on proximity to training examples. It does not have explicit, adjustable weights assigned to input variables. D. Neural network: Like deep learning models, standard neural networks are "black box" models.

206. An AI practitioner wants to generate more diverse and more creative outputs from a large language model (LLM). How should the AI practitioner adjust the inference parameter?

A. Increase the temperature value.
B. Decrease the Top K value.
C. Increase the response length.
D. Decrease the prompt length.

**Correct answer:** A. Increase the temperature value.

The temperature inference parameter directly controls the randomness of the output from a large language model (LLM). When the temperature value is increased, it flattens the probability distribution of potential next tokens. This makes the model more likely to select less probable, more unexpected words, leading to outputs that are more diverse, creative, and novel. Conversely, a lower temperature makes the model's output more deterministic and focused on the most likely words. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Decreasing the Top K value restricts the model's choices to a smaller set of the most probable next words, which reduces diversity and creativity. C. Increasing the response length only makes the output longer; it does not inherently change the creativity or diversity of the token selection process itself. D. Decreasing the prompt length provides less context to the model, which can lead to less relevant or focused output, but it is not a direct control for creativity.

207. A company wants to improve the accuracy of the responses from a generative AI application. The application uses a foundation model (FM) on Amazon Bedrock. Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Fine-tune the FM.
B. Retrain the FM.
C. Train a new FM.
D. Use prompt engineering.

**Correct answer:** D. Use prompt engineering.

Prompt engineering is the most cost-effective method for improving the accuracy of a foundation model's (FM) responses. This technique involves iteratively refining the input (the prompt) to better guide the model toward the desired output. It requires no additional data labeling, no model training compute costs, and no fees for hosting a separate custom model. By simply improving the clarity, context, and instructions within the prompt, developers can significantly enhance response accuracy and relevance using the existing FM. This makes it the ideal first step and the most economical approach compared to modifying the model itself. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Fine-tune the FM. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a labeled dataset, which incurs costs for data preparation, the training process itself, and hosting the resulting custom model. B. Retrain the FM. Retraining a large FM from scratch is a massive undertaking, requiring enormous datasets and extreme computational power, making it prohibitively expensive and impractical for this goal. C. Train a new FM. Similar to retraining, training a new FM is the most complex and costly option, reserved for organizations with vast resources and highly specific needs not met by existing models.

208. Which AI technique combines large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge bases to improve response accuracy?

A. Reinforcement learning (RL)
B. Natural language processing (NLP)
C. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
D. Transfer learning

**Correct answer:** C. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a specific AI framework designed to improve the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs). It works by first retrieving relevant information from an external, authoritative knowledge base (such as a document repository or database) based on the user's query. This retrieved data is then provided as additional context to the LLM along with the original prompt. By grounding the model's response in this external, factual data, RAG helps to reduce hallucinations, improve factual accuracy, and allow the model to answer questions about information not present in its original training data. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Reinforcement learning (RL): This is a training paradigm where a model learns by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions, not a method for integrating external knowledge at inference time. B. Natural language processing (NLP): This is a broad field of AI concerned with language understanding and generation. RAG is a specific technique within the field of NLP. D. Transfer learning: This is the practice of applying knowledge from a pre-trained model to a different but related problem. While foundational to LLMs, it is not the technique for augmenting them with external data sources for a query.

210. A company trained an ML model on Amazon SageMaker to predict customer credit risk. The model shows 90% recall on training data and 40% recall on unseen testing data. Which conclusion can the company draw from these results?

A. The model is overfitting on the training data.
B. The model is underfitting on the training data.
C. The model has insufficient training data.
D. The model has insufficient testing data.

**Correct answer:** A. The model is overfitting on the training data.

The scenario describes a classic case of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including its noise and specific details, to the point where it negatively impacts the model's performance on new, unseen data. The high recall (90%) on the training data indicates the model has successfully memorized the patterns within that set. However, the significantly lower recall (40%) on the testing data shows that the model fails to generalize its learning to new data, which is the hallmark of overfitting. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. The model is underfitting on the training data. Underfitting is characterized by poor performance on both the training and testing data, which is not the case here as the training recall is high (90%). C. The model has insufficient training data. While insufficient training data can be a cause of overfitting, the direct conclusion from the performance metrics is the phenomenon of overfitting itself, not its underlying cause. D. The model has insufficient testing data. The size of the testing data affects the statistical confidence in the evaluation metric, but it does not explain the large performance gap between training and testing results.

A. The process of fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on labeled data for a specific task
B. The process of providing unlabeled data to a pre-trained language model to improve the model's domain knowledge
C. The process of training a language model from the beginning on a specific dataset
D. The process of evaluating the performance of a pre-trained language model on a test set

**Correct answer:** B. The process of providing unlabeled data to a pre-trained language model to improve the model's domain knowledge

Continued pre-training is the process of taking a general-purpose, pre-trained foundation model and further training it on a large corpus of unlabeled, domain-specific data. The goal is not to teach the model a new task, but to adapt its existing knowledge to the specific vocabulary, nuances, and context of a particular domain, such as finance, law, or medicine. This domain adaptation improves the model's performance on subsequent fine-tuning for tasks within that specific domain. It uses the same self-supervised learning objectives as the initial pre-training phase. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A: This describes supervised fine-tuning, which uses labeled data to adapt a model for a specific downstream task, not to improve general domain knowledge. C: This describes training a model from scratch, which is the opposite of leveraging a pre-trained model as a starting point. D: This describes the model evaluation or inference phase, which measures performance but does not involve any training or adaptation of the model.

A. Unsupervised learning
B. Supervised learning
C. Reinforcement learning
D. Semi-supervised learning

**Correct answer:** A. Unsupervised learning

The task is to "automatically group similar customers and products based on their characteristics." This process is known as clustering. Clustering is a fundamental technique in unsupervised learning, where the goal is to find hidden patterns and structures in unlabeled data. The algorithm groups data points (customers or products) based on their intrinsic similarities without any predefined labels or target outcomes. This directly matches the requirement of discovering natural groupings within the dataset. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Supervised learning: Requires a dataset with pre-existing, correct labels (e.g., customers already assigned to specific groups) to train a model for prediction, which is not the scenario described. C. Reinforcement learning: Involves an agent learning to make optimal decisions through trial and error to maximize a cumulative reward, which is not applicable to grouping static data. D.

213. Which term is the speed at which a pre-trained foundation model (FM) processes requests and delivers output?

A. Model size
B. Inference latency
C. Context window
D. Fine-tuning

**Correct answer:** B. Inference latency

Inference latency is the measure of time it takes for a machine learning model to process an input request (a prompt) and generate an output (a response). This metric is a critical performance indicator for real-time applications, as lower latency corresponds to a faster response time. The term directly addresses the "speed" at which a foundation model operates during the inference phase, which is when it is actively being used to make predictions or generate content after it has been trained. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Model size: This refers to the number of parameters in a model, which affects memory requirements and can influence speed, but it is not the measure of speed itself. C. Context window: This defines the maximum number of tokens (input and output) the model can process in a single turn, representing its input capacity, not its processing speed. D. Fine-tuning: This is the process of adapting a pre-trained model for a specific task by training it on a smaller, specialized dataset; it is a training method, not a performance metric.

214. A company is using a large language model (LLM) on Amazon Bedrock to build a chatbot. The chatbot processes customer support requests. To resolve a request, the customer and the chatbot must interact a few times. Which solution gives the LLM the ability to use content from previous customer messages?

A. Turn on model invocation logging to collect messages.
B. Add messages to the model prompt.
C. Use Amazon Personalize to save conversation history.
D. Use Provisioned Throughput for the LLM.

**Correct answer:** B. Add messages to the model prompt.

Large language models (LLMs) are inherently stateless, meaning they do not retain memory of past interactions between API calls. To create a conversational experience where the model "remembers" previous turns, the application must manage the conversation history. The standard method is to append the history of the user's and the model's messages to the input prompt for each new turn. This provides the necessary context for the LLM to generate a coherent and relevant response based on the entire conversation. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Turn on model invocation logging to collect messages. Model invocation logging is for auditing, debugging, and monitoring purposes. It records prompts and responses but does not actively feed this history back into the model for subsequent turns. C. Use Amazon Personalize to save conversation history. Amazon Personalize is a machine learning service for creating real-time personalized recommendations. It is not designed for managing or providing conversational context to an LLM. D. Use Provisioned Throughput for the LLM. Provisioned Throughput is a pricing and performance model that guarantees inference capacity. It affects the speed and availability of the model but has no impact on its conversational memory capabilities. ---

A. Faithfulness
B. Recall
C. Mean reciprocal rank
D. Precision

**Correct answer:** B. Recall

Recall is the metric that measures the ability of a model to find all the relevant instances within a dataset. In the context of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, recall for the retrieval component specifically measures the fraction of all relevant documents that were successfully retrieved. A high recall score indicates that the system is effective at not missing important, relevant information for a given query, which directly addresses the company's goal. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Faithfulness: This measures if the generated answer is factually supported by the retrieved context, which evaluates the generation step, not the retrieval of all relevant documents. C. Mean reciprocal rank: This metric evaluates how highly the first relevant document is ranked in the search results, not whether all relevant documents were retrieved. D. Precision: This measures the proportion of retrieved documents that are relevant. A system can have high precision by returning only one relevant document, while missing many others.

A. A stock prediction model decreases in accuracy after testing on new data.
B. A loan default risk model uses only credit scores to assess risk.
C. A sales prediction model uses only one month to forecast yearly revenue.
D. A student performance model uses only the number of advanced classes that a student has taken to assess performance.

**Correct answer:** A. A stock prediction model decreases in accuracy after testing on new data.

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and random fluctuations. This results in high performance on the training data but poor performance on new, unseen data. The scenario where a stock prediction model's accuracy decreases when tested on new data is a classic example of this phenomenon. The model has failed to generalize from the training data to new data, which is the defining characteristic of overfitting. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. A loan default risk model using only credit scores is likely too simple and suffers from high bias, which is characteristic of underfitting, not overfitting. C. Using only one month of data to forecast a year is an issue of insufficient and non-representative training data, which would lead to a poorly generalized model, likely underfitting. D. A student performance model using only one feature is overly simplistic and would likely underfit the data by failing to capture the complexity of the problem.

A. Use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
B. Use few-shot prompting.
C. Set the temperature to 1.
D. Decrease the token size.

**Correct answer:** A. Use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is the ideal technique for this scenario. RAG enhances a large language model's (LLM) responses by first retrieving relevant information from an external, authoritative knowledge base-in this case, the company's human resources documentation. This retrieved context is then provided to the LLM along with the user's original query. This process grounds the model's answer in the company's specific, up-to-date policies, significantly improving accuracy and reducing the risk of generating incorrect or "hallucinated" information. It directly addresses the need to use a large digital documentation base to answer specific questions. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Use few-shot prompting: This technique provides a few examples in the prompt to guide the model's response format, but it cannot incorporate a large, external knowledge base like an entire HR documentation library. C. Set the temperature to 1: Temperature controls response creativity. A value of 1 increases randomness, which is undesirable for factual, policy-based answers. A lower temperature (closer to 0) is needed for deterministic, factual responses. D. Decrease the token size: This refers to limiting the length of the input or output. Decreasing it would not help the model access the necessary information and might truncate important context or the final answer. ---

A. Context relevance
B. Context coverage
C. Faithfulness
D. Root mean square error (RMSE)

**Correct answer:** C. Faithfulness

For a summarization task, faithfulness is a crucial metric that evaluates whether the generated summary is factually consistent with the original source text. When using Amazon Bedrock's LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, "Faithfulness" is a built-in, automated metric specifically designed for tasks like summarization. It helps ensure the model does not hallucinate or generate information that contradicts the input customer surveys, which is a primary concern for this use case. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Context relevance: This metric is used for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to evaluate if the retrieved context is relevant to the user's query, not for summarization. B. Context coverage: This is also a RAG-specific metric that assesses if the retrieved context contains enough information to answer the query, which is not applicable to summarization. D. Root mean square error (RMSE): This is a regression metric used to measure the difference between predicted and actual numerical values, not for evaluating generated text.

A. F1 score
B. Mean squared error (MSE)
C. R-squared
D. Time used to train the model

**Correct answer:** A. F1 score

Predicting customer churn is a binary classification task, where the outcome is one of two categories (churn or no churn). The F1 score is a standard evaluation metric for such tasks. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single score that balances the trade-off between the two. This is particularly useful in scenarios like churn prediction, where the classes might be imbalanced (i.e., far fewer customers churn than do not). The F1 score effectively measures the model's accuracy on the positive class. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Mean squared error (MSE): This metric is used to evaluate regression models, which predict continuous numerical values, not categorical labels like churn/no-churn. C. R-squared: Also known as the coefficient of determination, this is another metric used exclusively for evaluating the performance of regression models. D. Time used to train the model: This measures computational efficiency and resource consumption, not the predictive accuracy or correctness of the model's classifications.

**Correct answer:** B. K-means

The scenario requires grouping a large amount of unlabeled data based on feature similarities. This is a classic definition of a clustering problem, which falls under unsupervised machine learning. The K-means algorithm is a fundamental and widely used unsupervised clustering algorithm. It partitions a dataset into 'K' distinct, non-overlapping clusters by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest cluster centroid and then recalculating the centroids. This process effectively groups data points based on their similarity in the feature space, directly addressing the company's requirement without needing pre-existing labels. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. XGBoost is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression; it requires labeled data to train a predictive model. C. DeepAR forecasting is a supervised learning algorithm specifically designed for time-series forecasting, not for grouping static data points. D. Linear learner is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, which necessitates labeled training data.

C. Incorporating continuous human feedback across model development, training, and deployment phases and using performance evaluation to improve model accuracy
D. Implementing reinforcement learning algorithms that automatically adjust model parameters based on predefined success metrics without human oversight

**Correct answer:** C. Incorporating continuous human feedback across model development, training, and deployment phases and using performance evaluation to improve model accuracy

A human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach fundamentally involves integrating human judgment into the machine learning cycle to improve model performance. The most effective HITL strategy is continuous and spans the entire ML lifecycle. This includes humans labeling data during development, providing feedback on model outputs during training (like in RLHF), and reviewing low-confidence predictions during deployment. This continuous feedback loop allows for iterative refinement and improves model accuracy, robustness, and alignment over time. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Using automated testing scripts... without human intervention: This describes an automated MLOps pipeline, which is the opposite of a human-in-the-loop approach. B. Collecting human feedback during only the initial training phase: This is not a continuous approach and fails to leverage human feedback throughout the entire lifecycle for ongoing improvement. D.

A. Few-shot prompting
B. Zero-shot prompting
C. Directional stimulus prompting
D. Chain-of-thought prompting

**Correct answer:** D. Chain-of-thought prompting

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique specifically designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for complex tasks. It works by encouraging the model to break down a problem into a series of intermediate, sequential steps before providing a final answer. This method explicitly generates the detailed, step-by-step explanation process required by the company, thereby enhancing the model's performance on tasks that demand logical deduction and multi-step reasoning. By externalizing the reasoning process, CoT makes the model's output more transparent, reliable, and accurate for complex problem-solving scenarios. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Few-shot prompting: This technique provides examples of input-output pairs to guide the model, but it does not inherently force the model to explain its reasoning process step-by-step. B. Zero-shot prompting: This method provides no examples and relies solely on the model's pre-existing knowledge, making it unsuitable for complex problems that benefit from a structured reasoning framework. C. Directional stimulus prompting: This is a general term for guiding a model's output style or topic, not a specific, established technique for eliciting a detailed, step-by-step logical process.

**Prompts:**
- Create high-quality images that are influenced by the generated slogans and product
- Create contextually relevant slogans based on the advertisement product
- Ensure that company brand elements are properly placed in the images

**Term Bank:**
- Diffusion model
- Transformer-based model
- Object detection model

**Correct answer:** Create high-quality images that are influenced by the generated slogans and product → Diffusion model | Create contextually relevant slogans based on the advertisement product → Transformer-based model | Ensure that company brand elements are properly placed in the images → Object detection model

Diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) are the current state-of-the-art for image generation, functioning by iteratively denoising random noise to synthesize high-fidelity visuals based on text conditioning. Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT, BERT) utilize self-attention mechanisms to process and generate sequential data, making them the standard for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like writing slogans. Finally, Object detection models (e.g., YOLO, R-CNN) are discriminative models designed specifically to localize and classify entities within an image (bounding boxes). To "ensure" brand elements are properly placed, a detection model is required to verify the coordinates and existence of logos or products within the generated frame.

237. A financial company is building an ML model to classify fraudulent transactions based on customer data and transaction patterns. The company wants to evaluate the model's performance. The company must ensure that the model makes correct predictions and minimizes false positives. Which evaluation metric will meet these requirements?

A. Accuracy
B. R-squared
C. F1 score
D. Root mean squared error (RMSE)

**Correct answer:** C. F1 score

In fraud detection, datasets are often imbalanced (few fraudulent transactions vs. many legitimate ones). The goal is to correctly identify fraud (high recall) while not incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions (high precision), which is what "minimizes false positives" means. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns. It is a more robust measure than accuracy for imbalanced classification problems and directly addresses the need to balance correct predictions with the cost of false positives. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Accuracy can be misleading on imbalanced datasets, as a model could achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority (non-fraudulent) class. B. R-squared is a regression metric used to measure the proportion of variance explained by a model; it is not applicable to classification tasks. D.

The company wants to minimize the amount of time the employees spend reviewing flagged fraud cases that are not actually fraudulent. Which evaluation metric meets these requirements?

A. Recall
B. Accuracy
C. Precision
D. Lift chart

**Correct answer:** C. Precision

The company's goal is to minimize the time employees spend reviewing flagged cases that are not actually fraudulent. This means they want to reduce the number of false positives (cases incorrectly flagged as fraud). The evaluation metric that directly measures this is Precision. Precision calculates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions (True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)). A higher precision score indicates that when the model flags a transaction, it is very likely to be actual fraud, thus reducing wasted review time. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Recall: Recall (or sensitivity) measures the model's ability to identify all actual fraud cases. It focuses on minimizing missed fraud (false negatives), not on the cost of false alarms. B. Accuracy: Accuracy measures the overall correct predictions. It can be a misleading metric for imbalanced datasets, common in fraud detection, where a model could achieve high accuracy by simply classifying all transactions as non-fraudulent. D. Lift chart: A lift chart is a visual tool used to assess a model's performance against a random guess, rather than a single, specific metric to minimize the review of false positives.

- Continued pre-training

**Correct answer:** The models must be taught a new domain-specific task → Model fine-tuning | A limited amount of labeled data is available and more data is needed → Data augmentation | Only unlabeled data is available → Continued pre-training

Model fine-tuning is a supervised learning process that updates the weights of a pre-trained model using a labeled dataset to optimize it for a specific downstream task. Data augmentation is the technique specifically designed to address data scarcity by synthesizing new training examples from existing labeled data (e.g., via paraphrasing or back-translation in NLP), thereby increasing dataset size and diversity. Continued pre-training (also known as domain-adaptive pre-training) involves training a model on a large corpus of unlabeled data to adapt its internal representations to a specific domain's vocabulary and structure before any supervised fine-tuning takes place.

A. Continuous pre-training
B. Supervised learning
C. Reinforcement learning
D. Boosting

**Correct answer:** A. Continuous pre-training

Continuous pre-training (also known as domain adaptation) is the technique of taking a pre-trained large language model (LLM) and continuing its training on a large, unlabeled, domain-specific corpus. In this case, the medical papers serve as the domain-specific corpus. This process helps the model learn the vocabulary, nuances, and specific knowledge of the medical field without altering its fundamental capabilities. This is distinct from fine-tuning, which typically uses a smaller, labeled dataset to adapt the model for a specific task (like question-answering). The goal here is to familiarize the LLM with a topic, which is the primary purpose of continuous pre-training. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Supervised learning (or fine-tuning) requires a labeled dataset (e.g., question-answer pairs), not a large corpus of papers, to train a model for a specific task. C. Reinforcement learning trains a model based on a system of rewards and penalties, which is not applicable for learning from a static corpus of medical papers. D.

C. Fine-tuning keeps the FM's knowledge up to date by pre-training the FM on more recent data.
D. Fine-tuning improves the performance of the FM on a specific task by further training the FM on new labeled data.

**Correct answer:** D. Fine-tuning improves the performance of the FM on a specific task by further training the FM on new labeled data.

Fine-tuning is a form of transfer learning where a pre-trained foundation model (FM) is further trained on a smaller, task-specific labeled dataset. This process adapts the model's general knowledge and capabilities to excel at a particular task, such as sentiment analysis, document summarization, or classification for a specific domain. By adjusting the model's weights using this new data, fine-tuning significantly improves performance and accuracy for the target use case beyond what the general-purpose base model can achieve. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Fine-tuning does not inherently reduce a model's size or complexity. Techniques like pruning or quantization do, but that is a separate process. Slower inference is a disadvantage, not a benefit. B. The core value of fine-tuning is leveraging the pre-trained model's knowledge, thus avoiding the immense cost and data requirements of retraining a model from scratch. C.

248. A company is building an AI application to summarize books of varying lengths. During testing, the application fails to summarize some books. Why does the application fail to summarize some books?

A. The temperature is set too high.
B. The selected model does not support fine-tuning.
C. The Top P value is too high.
D. The input tokens exceed the model's context size.

**Correct answer:** D. The input tokens exceed the model's context size.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have a finite "context window" or "context size," which is the maximum number of tokens (input plus output) they can process in a single request. Books can vary significantly in length, and a long book can easily be converted into a number of tokens that exceeds this limit. When the input text is too large for the model's context window, the model cannot process the request and will typically return an error, causing the application to fail. This explains why the application succeeds with shorter books but fails with some longer ones. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. The temperature is set too high. Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of the output. A high value would produce a creative or nonsensical summary, not cause the application to fail to process the input. B. The selected model does not support fine-tuning. Fine-tuning is a process for adapting a model to a specific task. Whether a model supports it is irrelevant to its ability to perform inference on an input during testing. C. The Top P value is too high. Similar to temperature, Top P (nucleus sampling) controls output randomness. It affects the quality and diversity of the summary but does not cause a processing failure based on input length.

**Correct answer:** Amount of information that can fit in a single prompt → Context windows | Length of time it takes for a model to generate an output → Latency | Multiple users invoking an application endpoint simultaneously → Concurrency

Context windows: This term defines the maximum limit of tokens (text or data) a model can accept and process in a single interaction. It dictates the "amount of information" (such as long documents or extensive instructions) effectively held in the model's short-term memory for that specific prompt. Latency: In the context of generative AI, latency refers to the time delay between a user issuing a request (prompt) and the model completing the generation of the response. It is the primary metric for the "speed" of the model's output generation. Concurrency: This refers to the ability of the hosting infrastructure or application endpoint to handle multiple simultaneous requests (invocations) from different users. High concurrency ensures the system remains responsive under load from many users at once.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): RAG is defined by the retrieval of relevant documents from external sources (non-parametric memory) to combine with the model's internal knowledge for generation. This directly addresses "enhancing... by using external sources" (Lewis et al., 2020). Zero-shot learning: This technique involves querying a model to perform a task without providing any examples (shots) or gradient updates. The model must generalize to the unseen task based solely on its pre-training and the natural language instruction (Brown et al., 2020). Few-shot learning: This is defined as querying a model with a limited amount of data (specifically, $k$ examples where $10 k 100$) in the context window to define a new task. It relies on in-context learning rather than weight updates (Brown et al., 2020).

253. An AI practitioner is using Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management to create a reusable prompt. The prompt must be able to interact with external services by calling an external API. Which solution will meet this requirement?

A. Use special tokens.
B. Use a tools configuration.
C. Use prompt variables.
D. Use a stop sequence.

**Correct answer:** B. Use a tools configuration.

Amazon Bedrock enables foundation models to interact with external services through a feature called "tool use" (also known as function calling). To implement this, an AI practitioner provides a toolConfig in the API request. This configuration defines the available tools (APIs), including their names, descriptions, and input schemas. When a user prompt requires an external action, the model identifies the appropriate tool and generates a request to invoke it. This allows the prompt to trigger external API calls and incorporate the results into the final response, making the model's capabilities extensible. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Use special tokens: Special tokens (e.g., CLS, SEP) are used by models for structural purposes like marking sentence boundaries, not for invoking external APIs. C. Use prompt variables: Prompt variables are placeholders (e.g., username) used in prompt templates to insert dynamic content, but they do not trigger external function calls. D. Use a stop sequence: A stop sequence is a specific string of characters that instructs the model to stop generating further text, used to control output length and format.

254. A company is using a pre-trained large language model (LLM). The LLM must perform multiple tasks that require specific domain knowledge. The LLM does not have information about several technical topics in the domain. The company has unlabeled data that the company can use to fine-tune the model. Which fine-tuning method will meet these requirements?

A. Full training
B. Supervised fine-tuning
C. Continued pre-training
D. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Correct answer:** C. Continued pre-training

Continued pre-training, also known as domain-adaptive pre-training, is the appropriate method for this scenario. This technique involves taking a general-purpose, pre-trained LLM and continuing the pre-training process using a large corpus of unlabeled, domain-specific data. The goal is to adapt the model's internal knowledge and representations to the new domain's vocabulary, nuances, and concepts. Since the company has unlabeled technical data and needs the model to learn this new domain knowledge for multiple tasks, continued pre-training is the ideal approach. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Full training: This involves training a model from scratch, which is computationally prohibitive and unnecessary when a capable pre-trained model is already available. B. Supervised fine-tuning: This method requires a labeled dataset of high-quality examples (e.g., instruction-response pairs). The company only has unlabeled data, making this option unsuitable. D. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): RAG is an architectural pattern, not a fine-tuning method. It enhances an LLM by retrieving external information at inference time but does not update the model's internal weights or knowledge.

255. A company plans to use a generative AI model to provide real-time service quotes to users. Which criteria should the company use to select the correct model for this use case?

A. Model size
B. Training data quality
C. General-purpose use and high-powered GPU availability
D. Model latency and optimized inference speed

**Correct answer:** D. Model latency and optimized inference speed

The core requirement of the use case is providing "real-time" service quotes. In this context, "real-time" implies that the system must respond to a user's request with minimal delay to ensure a positive user experience. Therefore, the most critical criteria for selecting a model are its performance characteristics. Model latency, which is the time taken from request to response, and optimized inference speed, the rate at which the model can generate predictions, are the primary metrics that determine if a model is suitable for a real-time application. A model with low latency and high inference speed can deliver quotes quickly, meeting the business requirement. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Model size is a contributing factor to latency and cost, but it is not the direct selection criterion. The resulting performance (latency) is the critical metric, not the size itself. B. Training data quality is a fundamental requirement for the accuracy of any AI model, not a specific selection criterion for a real-time use case over other types of applications. C. A specialized model is often more efficient than a general-purpose one for a specific task. GPU availability is an infrastructure consideration, not a primary model selection criterion.

256. An airline company wants to use a generative AI model to convert a flight booking system from one coding language into another coding language. The company must select a model for this task. Which criteria should the company use to select the correct generative AI model for this task?

A. Syntax, semantic understanding, and code optimization capabilities
B. Code generation speed and error handling capabilities
C. Ability to generate creative content
D. Model size and resource requirements

**Correct answer:** A. Syntax, semantic understanding, and code optimization capabilities

For a generative AI model to successfully translate a complex system like a flight booking application, it must possess a deep, multi-faceted understanding of code. It must first parse the grammatical rules of both the source and target languages (syntax). More critically, it needs to comprehend the underlying logic, intent, and functionality of the original code (semantic understanding) to ensure the translation is functionally equivalent. Finally, a superior model will also have code optimization capabilities, allowing it to generate code that is not only correct but also efficient and idiomatic for the target language's ecosystem, which is crucial for long-term maintenance and performance. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Code generation speed is secondary to correctness. Error handling is a subset of semantic understanding, not a complete criterion on its own. C. The ability to generate creative content is irrelevant for a logical and precise task like code translation, which requires accuracy over novelty. D. Model size and resource requirements are operational and deployment considerations, not primary criteria for evaluating the model's ability to perform the translation task correctly.

258. A design company is using a foundation model (FM) on Amazon Bedrock to generate images for various projects. The company wants to have control over how detailed or abstract each generated image appears. Which model parameter should the company modify?

A. Model checkpoint
B. Batch size
C. Generation step
D. Token length

**Correct answer:** C. Generation step

In diffusion-based image generation models, such as those available on Amazon Bedrock (e.g., Stable Diffusion), the image is created through an iterative process. The process starts with random noise and refines it over a series of steps. The "generation step" parameter (often called steps or numinferencesteps) controls how many of these refinement iterations are performed. A higher number of steps generally results in a more detailed and higher-quality image, while a lower number can produce a more abstract or less refined result. This directly allows the company to control the level of detail. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Model checkpoint: A model checkpoint is a saved version of the model itself. Changing it would switch to a different model variant, not adjust the detail of a single generation. B. Batch size: Batch size determines how many images are generated simultaneously in a single request. It affects performance and throughput, not the detail level of each individual image. D. Token length: Token length is a parameter relevant to text generation models, controlling the length of the output text. It is not a parameter used to control image detail.

A. K-nearest neighbors (K-NN)
B. K-means
C. Decision tree
D. Support vector machine

**Correct answer:** B. K-means

The requirement is to identify natural groupings of customers based on their data, without pre-existing labels for these groups. This is a classic example of an unsupervised learning problem known as clustering. The K-means algorithm is a fundamental and widely used unsupervised clustering algorithm. It partitions a dataset into 'K' distinct, non-overlapping clusters by grouping data points based on their similarity, making it the ideal choice for customer segmentation based on demographics and buying patterns. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression, which requires pre-labeled data to function. C. Decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that creates a model to predict a target variable, requiring a labeled dataset for training. D. Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm primarily used for classification, which needs labeled data to find a separating boundary between classes.

A. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score
B. F1 score
C. BERT Score
D. Real World Knowledge (RWK) score

**Correct answer:** C. BERT Score

Amazon Bedrock's automatic model evaluation feature for text summarization tasks is designed to assess the quality of the generated output against a reference summary. To evaluate accuracy, it employs metrics that measure semantic similarity and content overlap. BERTScore is a supported metric that leverages contextual embeddings from BERT models to compare the semantic similarity between the generated summary and the reference text. This makes it highly effective for evaluating the nuanced meaning and accuracy of generative summarization models, going beyond simple word-matching. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score: This metric is used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models, not for assessing the quality of generated text in a summarization task. B. F1 score: While used in NLP, the F1 score is typically for classification or information extraction tasks. It measures the harmonic mean of precision and recall based on token overlap, not semantic meaning. D. Real World Knowledge (RWK) score: This is not a standard, selectable metric within the Amazon Bedrock automatic model evaluation framework for summarization. Accuracy is measured by metrics like BERTScore, ROUGE, and METEOR.

261. A company wants to use a large language model (LLM) to generate product descriptions. The company wants to give the model example descriptions that follow a format. Which prompt engineering technique will generate descriptions that match the format?

A. Zero-shot prompting
B. Chain-of-thought prompting
C. One-shot prompting
D. Few-shot prompting

**Correct answer:** D. Few-shot prompting

Few-shot prompting is a technique where a user provides multiple examples (i.e., "shots") of the desired input-output behavior in the prompt. By showing the Large Language Model (LLM) several "example descriptions" that adhere to a specific format, the company is conditioning the model to understand the pattern and generate new, unseen product descriptions in the same format. This in-context learning approach is highly effective for tasks requiring specific styling, formatting, or structure, as described in the scenario. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Zero-shot prompting is incorrect because it involves providing no examples; the model is expected to perform the task based only on the instruction. B. Chain-of-thought prompting is incorrect as it is used for complex reasoning tasks by showing the model intermediate logical steps, not primarily for format adherence. C. One-shot prompting is less accurate because it uses only a single example. The question specifies "example descriptions" (plural), making few-shot prompting the more appropriate choice.

A. Maximum token count
B. On-demand inference parameter support
C. The ability to control model output randomness
D. Compatibility with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails

**Correct answer:** A. Maximum token count

The maximum token count, also known as the context window size, is a fundamental architectural characteristic that varies significantly among the different large language models (LLMs) available in Amazon Bedrock. For instance, Amazon Titan models have a different maximum token limit compared to Anthropic's Claude models. An AI practitioner must design a prompt that fits within the smallest maximum token count of all target models to ensure it works universally. A prompt exceeding a specific model's limit will result in an error, making this a critical differing characteristic to consider for cross-model compatibility. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. On-demand inference parameter support: While specific parameter names can differ (e.g., maxTokens vs. maxtokenstosample), the fundamental support for on-demand inference with parameters is a common feature of the Bedrock service. C. The ability to control model output randomness: This is a standard feature across all generative LLMs in Amazon Bedrock, typically managed via common conceptual parameters like temperature and topp. D.

A. Deploy the model by using an Amazon EC2 compute optimized instance.
B. Use the model with on-demand throughput on Amazon Bedrock.
C. Store the model in Amazon S3 and host the model by using AWS Lambda.
D. Purchase Provisioned Throughput for the model on Amazon Bedrock.

**Correct answer:** D. Purchase Provisioned Throughput for the model on Amazon Bedrock.

The question requires the most cost-effective solution for a custom Amazon Bedrock model with a steady, predictable request rate. Amazon Bedrock's Provisioned Throughput is specifically designed for this scenario. It allows customers to purchase a dedicated amount of processing capacity for a specific model for a set term (e.g., one or six months). For consistent workloads, this model provides a significant discount compared to the on-demand, pay-per-use pricing, ensuring both guaranteed performance and the lowest cost for a steady traffic pattern. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Deploying on EC2 removes the model from the fully managed Bedrock environment, increasing operational overhead and complexity, which is unlikely to be more cost-effective. B. The on-demand throughput model is priced per token and is best suited for intermittent or unpredictable workloads. For a steady rate, it is more expensive than Provisioned Throughput. C. Hosting a large language model (LLM) on AWS Lambda is generally not feasible due to limitations on deployment package size, memory, and execution duration.

265. A company is training ML models on datasets. The datasets contain some classes that have more examples than other classes. The company wants to measure how well the model balances detecting and labeling the classes. Which metric should the company use?

A. Accuracy
B. Recall
C. Precision
D. F1 score

**Correct answer:** D. F1 score

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is the most suitable metric for this scenario because the dataset has a class imbalance. The F1 score provides a single, balanced measure of a model's performance by considering both false positives (measured by precision) and false negatives (measured by recall). In imbalanced datasets, accuracy can be misleadingly high. The F1 score, however, effectively evaluates how well the model performs on the minority class, directly addressing the company's need to balance the detection (recall) and correct labeling (precision) of all classes. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Accuracy: This metric is misleading for imbalanced datasets because a high score can be achieved by simply predicting the majority class, while failing to identify the minority class. B. Recall: This metric only measures the model's ability to identify all positive instances (minimizing false negatives) and does not account for false positives, failing to provide a balanced view. C. Precision: This metric only measures the proportion of correct positive predictions (minimizing false positives) and does not account for false negatives, thus it is not a balanced metric. ---

A. Nova Micro uses transformer-based architectures. Nova Lite does not use transformer-based architectures.
B. Nova Micro supports only text data. Nova Lite is optimized for numerical data.
C. Nova Micro supports only text. Nova Lite supports images, videos, and text.
D. Nova Micro runs only on CPUs. Nova Lite runs only on GPUs.

**Correct answer:** C. Nova Micro supports only text. Nova Lite supports images, videos, and text.

The question uses hypothetical model names ("Nova Micro," "Nova Lite") to test the general concept of foundation model (FM) capabilities. In real-world AWS services like the Amazon Titan family, models are offered with different specializations. Smaller, more cost-effective models are often unimodal, designed for a single data type like text (e.g., Amazon Titan Text Lite). More advanced models are frequently multimodal, capable of processing multiple data types such as text, images, and video. Given the company's requirement to process both documents (text) and images, a multimodal model is necessary. Option C accurately reflects this common distinction between different classes of foundation models. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Most modern FMs, regardless of size, are based on transformer architectures, making this an unlikely differentiator. B. FMs excel at processing unstructured data like text and images, not primarily numerical data. D. Hardware choice (CPU/GPU) depends on model size and performance needs, not a strict "only" limitation for a model class.

A. Apply continued pre-training
B. Create an agent
C. Perform fine-tuning
D. Develop prompt engineering

**Correct answer:** C. Perform fine-tuning

The process described is fine-tuning. Fine-tuning adapts a pre-trained foundation model (FM) to a specific task by further training it on a smaller, high-quality, labeled dataset. The e-commerce company has a "high-quality labeled dataset" and wants to "customize a foundation model" for the specific tasks of image categorization and specification extraction. This aligns perfectly with the definition and purpose of fine-tuning, which modifies the model's weights to improve its accuracy and performance on specialized tasks. Amazon Bedrock provides managed capabilities for fine-tuning supported FMs. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Continued pre-training adapts an FM to a specific domain using a large corpus of unlabeled data, not a task-specific labeled dataset. B. An agent uses an FM to orchestrate actions and call APIs to complete complex tasks; it does not involve training the model with a dataset. D. Prompt engineering involves crafting the input to guide the model's response without changing the model's underlying weights through training.

B. Use a pre-trained deep learning model and fine-tune the model on the dataset.
C. Use a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to classify the images.
D. Use a support vector machine (SVM) with manually engineered features for classification.

**Correct answer:** A. Use traditional ML algorithms with custom features extracted from the dataset.

The question requires a solution for image classification using pre-defined "custom features extracted from a dataset." This describes a classic machine learning pipeline where feature engineering is performed first, resulting in a structured dataset (a feature matrix). Traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) are specifically designed to train on such structured data. Implementing these models using libraries like scikit-learn or Amazon SageMaker's built-in algorithms is a standard, well-documented process that involves minimal development overhead once the features are available. This path represents the most direct and lowest-effort solution to the stated problem. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Use a pre-trained deep learning model and fine-tune the model on the dataset. This approach is incorrect because deep learning models learn features directly from raw data (images), which contradicts the requirement to use the company's pre-extracted custom features. C. Use a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to classify the images. This is incorrect as GANs are primarily used for generating new data samples, not for classification. Using a GAN for this task would be unnecessarily complex and inappropriate. D. Use a support vector machine (SVM) with manually engineered features for classification. This is a specific example of a traditional ML algorithm. While a valid method, option A is the better answer as it represents the entire class of appropriate, low-effort solutions, not just one specific instance.

D. Update the approval status of the model version to Approved.

**Correct answer:** A. Purchase Provisioned Throughput for the custom model.

To use a custom model that has been fine-tuned in Amazon Bedrock for a production use case, you must purchase Provisioned Throughput. This action reserves dedicated inference capacity for your specific custom model. It guarantees that the model is available to handle your application's workload with consistent throughput and low latency, which is essential for internal business processes like document summarization. Without Provisioned Throughput, access to the custom model is not guaranteed for sustained use. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B.

A. Hallucinations
B. Safety
C. Interpretability
D. Cost

**Correct answer:** A. Hallucinations

The problem described, where an AI model produces "incorrect numbers" or factually inaccurate information, is known as a hallucination. In the context of generative AI, a hallucination occurs when the model generates content that is nonsensical, factually incorrect, or not grounded in its training data, yet presents it as factual. This is a significant challenge in AI, particularly when models are used for tasks requiring high factual accuracy, such as financial budgeting. The model is essentially fabricating information that appears plausible but is demonstrably false. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B.

275. A company has set up a translation tool to help its customer service team handle issues from customers around the world. The company wants to evaluate the performance of the translation tool. The company sets up a parallel data process that compares the responses from the tool to responses from actual humans. Both sets of responses are generated on the same set of documents. Which strategy should the company use to evaluate the translation tool?

A. Use the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score to estimate the absolute translation quality of the two methods.
B. Use the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score to estimate the relative translation quality of the two methods.
C. Use the BERTScore to estimate the absolute translation quality of the two methods.
D. Use the BERTScore to estimate the relative translation quality of the two methods.

**Correct answer:** B. Use the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score to estimate the relative translation quality of the two methods.

The scenario describes comparing machine-generated translations to human-generated reference translations using a parallel dataset. This is a standard method for evaluating machine translation (MT) systems. The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score is a widely used metric for this exact purpose. BLEU measures the correspondence between a machine's output and high-quality human translations. However, BLEU scores are most meaningful when used for comparison. They effectively determine if one translation system is better than another on the same dataset, thus measuring relative quality. They are not designed to provide a standalone, universal measure of absolute quality. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. BLEU scores are not reliable for judging the absolute quality of a translation. A specific score does not have a universal meaning of "good" or "bad" without a comparative context. C. BERTScore, like BLEU, is a comparative metric. It measures semantic similarity against a reference but does not provide a standardized measure of absolute translation quality. D. While BERTScore is a valid and often superior metric for relative quality evaluation, BLEU is the more traditional, foundational, and commonly cited metric for this task, making it a primary strategy.

A. Configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies for SageMaker Studio to access Amazon Bedrock.
B. Configure Amazon Macie to proxy requests from SageMaker Studio to Amazon Bedrock.
C. Configure AWS PrivateLink endpoints for the Amazon Bedrock API endpoints in the VPC that SageMaker Studio is connected to.
D. Configure a new VPC for the Amazon Bedrock usage. Register the VPCs as peers.

**Correct answer:** C. Configure AWS PrivateLink endpoints for the Amazon Bedrock API endpoints in the VPC that SageMaker Studio is connected to.

The core requirement is to ensure network traffic between Amazon SageMaker Studio and Amazon Bedrock remains private and does not traverse the public internet. AWS PrivateLink is the service designed for this exact purpose. By creating an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Bedrock within the same VPC that SageMaker Studio uses, you establish a private, secure connection. All API calls from SageMaker Studio to Bedrock are then routed through this endpoint, keeping the traffic entirely on the AWS private network and satisfying the security requirement. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. IAM roles and policies control permissions (authentication and authorization), determining if SageMaker can access Bedrock, but they do not control the network path the connection takes. B. Amazon Macie is a data security service used to discover and protect sensitive data. It does not function as a network proxy or manage connectivity between services. D. Amazon Bedrock is a managed AWS service that does not run inside a customer-owned VPC. Therefore, you cannot use VPC peering, which is for connecting two VPCs.

When drift is detected, SageMaker Model Monitor can be configured to trigger alerts using Amazon CloudWatch, fulfilling the company's requirement to be notified when the application's performance degrades. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I): This service is used to build human review workflows for ML predictions, not for automatically monitoring and alerting on model performance drift. C. Amazon Rekognition: This is a managed AI service for image and video analysis. It is an application service itself, not a tool for monitoring the performance of other AI applications. D. AWS Trusted Advisor: This service provides recommendations to optimize an AWS environment across cost, performance, security, and fault tolerance. It does not monitor ML model-specific metrics like performance drift. ---

278. A company is building a generative AI application with a foundation model (FM). The application needs to automatically generate marketing emails. The company wants the application's output text to be creative and short in length. Which configuration of inference parameters will meet these requirements?

A. Decrease the temperature and the response length.
B. Increase the temperature and the response length.
C. Increase the temperature and decrease the response length.
D. Decrease the temperature and increase the response length.

**Correct answer:** C. Increase the temperature and decrease the response length.

To generate creative text, the temperature parameter should be increased. A higher temperature value increases the randomness of the model's output by making it more likely to choose less probable words, leading to more diverse and creative results. To ensure the output is short, the response length (often referred to as maxtokens or maxlength) parameter must be decreased. This parameter sets a hard limit on the number of tokens in the generated text. Therefore, increasing the temperature and decreasing the response length directly addresses both requirements for creative and short marketing emails. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Decreasing the temperature makes the model's output more deterministic and less creative, which is contrary to the requirement for creative marketing content. B. Increasing the response length would result in longer emails, directly violating the requirement for the output to be short. D. This configuration would produce long and deterministic (less creative) text, which is the opposite of both of the stated requirements.

A. Evaluate the model's performance on benchmark datasets.
B. Analyze the model's architecture and hyperparameters.
C. Assess the model's alignment with specific use cases.
D. Measure the computational resources required for model deployment.

**Correct answer:** C. Assess the model's alignment with specific use cases.

The most direct and reliable strategy to determine if a foundation model (FM) will be effective for a business is to assess its performance and alignment with the specific use cases it is intended to address. Business objectives are realized through successful implementation of these use cases. Therefore, evaluating the model using data, prompts, and metrics that are representative of the real-world business problem (e.g., summarizing customer support tickets, generating marketing copy) provides a clear measure of its potential value and effectiveness in achieving the desired business outcomes. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Evaluating on benchmark datasets measures a model's general capabilities but does not guarantee its performance on a company's specific, often niche, business tasks. B. Analyzing architecture and hyperparameters is a technical exercise for understanding a model's design, not for directly measuring its utility against business goals. D. Measuring computational resources is crucial for assessing cost and operational feasibility (TCO), but it does not evaluate the model's effectiveness or accuracy in solving the business problem.

280. A company is using a foundation model (FM) to generate creative marketing slogans for various products. The company wants to reuse a standard template with common instructions when generating slogans for different products. However, the company needs to add short descriptions for each product. Which Amazon Bedrock solution will meet these requirements?

A. Prompt management
B. Knowledge Bases
C. Model evaluation
D. Cross-region inference

**Correct answer:** A. Prompt management

The company's requirement is to reuse a standard set of instructions (a template) while dynamically inserting product-specific information. This practice is a core component of prompt engineering, often referred to as prompt management or templating. By creating a base prompt with placeholders for variables like the product description, the company can efficiently and consistently generate slogans for different products without rewriting the entire prompt each time. This approach ensures uniformity in the instructions given to the foundation model while allowing for customization. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Knowledge Bases: This feature is used for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to connect a foundation model to private data sources, which is not required for inserting short, predefined descriptions. C. Model evaluation: This is the process of testing and comparing the performance of different foundation models, not for constructing or managing the input prompts for a single model. D. Cross-region inference: This is a deployment strategy related to invoking a model in a different geographical AWS Region, which has no bearing on how prompts are created or managed.

281. An AI practitioner is using an Amazon SageMaker notebook to train an ML prediction model for fraud detection. The company wants the model to be accurate for an unseen dataset. Which two characteristics does the AI practitioner want the model to have?

A. High variance / high bias
B. High variance / low bias
C. Low variance / high bias
D. Low variance / low bias

**Correct answer:** D. Low variance / low bias

The goal for a model to be accurate on an unseen dataset is to achieve good generalization. This is accomplished by finding an optimal balance in the bias-variance tradeoff. A model with low bias makes fewer assumptions about the data, allowing it to capture the true underlying relationships. A model with low variance is not overly sensitive to the specific training data, meaning it does not model random noise (a condition known as overfitting). Therefore, the ideal model has both low bias and low variance, as this combination minimizes the expected error on new, unseen data, leading to high accuracy. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. High variance / high bias: This is the worst-case scenario, where the model is consistently incorrect (high bias) and its predictions are unstable (high variance). B. High variance / low bias: This describes an overfit model. It learns the training data too well, including noise, but fails to generalize to new data. C. Low variance / high bias: This describes an underfit model. It is too simple to capture the underlying data patterns, resulting in poor performance on all datasets.

282. A company uses foundation models (FMs) to automate daily tasks. An AI practitioner is creating system instructions that include context relevant to the tasks. The AI practitioner wants to save and reuse the instructions in daily interactions with FMs in Amazon Bedrock. Which Amazon Bedrock solution will meet these requirements?

A. Knowledge Bases
B. Guardrails
C. Playgrounds
D. Prompt management

**Correct answer:** D. Prompt management

The requirement is to create, save, and reuse system instructions for daily interactions with foundation models (FMs). This process is known as prompt management. Amazon Bedrock facilitates this within its console playgrounds (Chat, Text, Image). Users can define system instructions and other configurations and then save them as "presets." These presets can be loaded in future sessions, allowing the AI practitioner to efficiently reuse the same instructions without having to re-enter them, which directly meets the requirements. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Knowledge Bases: These are used for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to connect FMs to private data sources, not for saving and reusing the prompts or system instructions themselves. B. Guardrails: These are used to implement safety policies and content filters to control FM interactions, rather than managing and reusing prompts for specific tasks. C. Playgrounds: While playgrounds are the interface where prompt management occurs, the specific function of saving and reusing instructions is prompt management, not the environment itself.

283. An AI practitioner trained a custom model on Amazon Bedrock by using a training dataset that contains confidential dat a. The AI practitioner wants to ensure that the custom model does not generate inference responses based on confidential data. How should the AI practitioner prevent responses based on confidential data?

A. Delete the custom model. Remove the confidential data from the training dataset. Retrain the custom model.
B. Mask the confidential data in the inference responses by using dynamic data masking.
C. Encrypt the confidential data in the inference responses by using Amazon SageMaker.
D. Encrypt the confidential data in the custom model by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

**Correct answer:** A. Delete the custom model. Remove the confidential data from the training dataset. Retrain the custom model.

When a machine learning model is trained, it learns patterns, relationships, and information from the training dataset, which are then encoded into the model's parameters (weights). If confidential data was included in this dataset, the model has inherently learned from it and may reproduce it or its patterns during inference. Post-processing outputs (masking, encryption) is unreliable and reactive. Encrypting the model artifact itself only protects the file at rest. Therefore, the only definitive method to ensure the model does not have knowledge of the confidential data is to remove that data from the training set and retrain the model from scratch. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Masking inference responses is a post-processing step that attempts to catch confidential data after it has already been generated, which is unreliable and does not solve the root problem. C. Encrypting inference responses protects the data in transit but does not prevent the model from generating the confidential information in the first place. D. Encrypting the custom model with AWS KMS protects the model artifact at rest but has no effect on the model's learned behavior or the content it generates during inference.

An AI practitioner is writing a report about the trained ML models to provide transparency and explainability to company stakeholders. What should the AI practitioner include in the report to meet the transparency and explainability requirements?

A. Code for model training
B. Partial dependence plots (PDPs)
C. Sample data for training
D. Model convergence tables

**Correct answer:** B. Partial dependence plots (PDPs)

Partial dependence plots (PDPs) are a primary tool for model-agnostic machine learning interpretability. They illustrate the marginal effect of one or two features on the predicted outcome of a model. By visualizing how a feature influences the model's predictions on average, PDPs provide a clear, human-understandable explanation of the model's behavior. Including PDPs in a report for stakeholders directly addresses the need for transparency and explainability by showing how key business drivers impact the forecasts, without requiring the audience to understand complex code or training metrics. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Code for model training: This is too technical for a general stakeholder audience and explains how the model was built, not why it makes its predictions. C. Sample data for training: While providing context, sample data alone does not explain the patterns or logic the model learned to make its forecasts. D. Model convergence tables: These are diagnostic metrics for data scientists to assess the training process; they do not explain the model's decision-making logic to stakeholders.

E. Ensure that the model's inference time is within the accepted limits.

**Correct answer:** A. Detect imbalances or disparities in the data. | C. Evaluate the model's behavior so that the company can provide transparency to stakeholders.

Building a responsible AI solution, especially in a sensitive domain like lending, requires a focus on fairness and transparency. A primary source of bias in AI models is the data they are trained on. Therefore, detecting and addressing imbalances or disparities in the data is a fundamental step to mitigate bias (A). Furthermore, to ensure accountability and build trust, it is crucial to evaluate the model's behavior. This allows the company to understand and explain the model's decisions, providing necessary transparency to customers, regulators, and other stakeholders (C). These two actions are core pillars of the AWS Responsible AI framework. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Ensuring the model runs frequently is an operational concern related to availability and performance, not a measure of its fairness or responsible design. D. ROUGE is a metric for evaluating text summarization, not for loan decision models. Also, aiming for 100% accuracy does not address the core issue of fairness or bias. E. Inference time is a performance metric (latency). A model can be fast but still produce biased and unfair outcomes, making this irrelevant to the core requirement.

A. Create a prompt template that teaches the LLM to detect attack patterns.
B. Increase the temperature parameter on invocation requests to the LLM.
C. Avoid using LLMs that are not listed in Amazon SageMaker.
D. Decrease the number of input tokens on invocations of the LLM.

**Correct answer:** A. Create a prompt template that teaches the LLM to detect attack patterns.

Creating a well-designed prompt template is a primary technique for mitigating prompt engineering attacks. This method, often called "instructional defense" or "prompt hardening," involves embedding specific instructions and constraints within the prompt itself. The template can instruct the Large Language Model (LLM) on its role, define its operational boundaries, and explicitly tell it to disregard user attempts to override its core directives. By teaching the LLM to recognize and reject malicious patterns (e.g., "ignore previous instructions"), the template acts as a critical guardrail, reducing the risk of the model performing undesirable actions or exposing sensitive data. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Increase the temperature parameter on invocation requests to the LLM. Increasing the temperature parameter makes the LLM's output more random and creative, which can increase unpredictability and does not provide a defense against malicious instructions. C. Avoid using LLMs that are not listed in Amazon SageMaker. The vulnerability to prompt engineering is inherent to how LLMs process language, not where they are hosted. Models from any source, including Amazon SageMaker, can be susceptible. D. Decrease the number of input tokens on invocations of the LLM. This is an ineffective control as many prompt injection attacks are short and concise. It would also severely limit the model's legitimate functionality by restricting user input length.

A. Data augmentation for imbalanced classes
B. Model monitoring for class distribution
C. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
D. Watermark detection for images

**Correct answer:** A. Data augmentation for imbalanced classes

The core problem identified is biased input data, where certain attributes are underrepresented, leading to a biased generative model. Data augmentation is a pre-processing technique used to address this issue. It involves creating new, synthetic data samples from the existing data, specifically for the underrepresented classes or attributes. By artificially increasing the number of examples for these minority groups, the training dataset becomes more balanced. This helps the model learn a more equitable representation, thereby mitigating the bias in the images it generates. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Model monitoring for class distribution: This is a post-deployment technique used to detect bias or data drift in a live model, but it does not correct the underlying issue in the training data itself. C.

D. Building and training a generative AI model from scratch by using specific data that a customer owns.

**Correct answer:** D. Building and training a generative AI model from scratch by using specific data that a customer owns.

According to the AWS Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix, the level of customer security responsibility increases with the degree of ownership over the generative AI stack. Building and training a model from scratch represents the highest level of ownership (Scope 4). In this scenario, the company is responsible for the entire lifecycle, including securing the proprietary training data, the model architecture, the training infrastructure, the resulting model artifact, and its deployment. This scope encompasses all security controls that would otherwise be managed by a foundation model (FM) provider or an application vendor in the other scenarios, thus giving the company the most ownership of security responsibilities. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. This scenario (Scope 1) represents the least customer responsibility, as the third-party vendor manages the application, the embedded model, and the underlying infrastructure. B. This scenario (Scope 2) offloads the security of the foundation model and its training to the third-party provider, leaving the company responsible only for its application and API interactions. C.

299. A company has installed a security camer a. The company uses an ML model to evaluate the security camera footage for potential thefts. The company has discovered that the model disproportionately flags people who are members of a specific ethnic group. Which type of bias is affecting the model output?

A. Measurement bias
B. Sampling bias
C. Observer bias
D. Confirmation bias

**Correct answer:** B. Sampling bias

The model's tendency to disproportionately flag individuals from a specific ethnic group is a classic example of sampling bias. This bias occurs when the training data is not a representative sample of the real-world population where the model is deployed. In this scenario, the model was likely trained on a dataset that either overrepresented the specific ethnic group in examples of theft or underrepresented them in non-theft examples. Consequently, the model learned a spurious correlation between ethnicity and the target outcome (theft), leading to biased and unfair predictions. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Measurement bias refers to systematic errors in the data collection process, such as a faulty camera or inconsistent labeling criteria, not the composition of the sample. C. Observer bias occurs when the beliefs of data labelers influence how data is annotated. While this can cause sampling bias, the resulting issue with the dataset itself is sampling bias. D. Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias where humans interpret new evidence as confirmation of their existing beliefs. It relates to human interpretation, not the model's operational flaw.

A. Use data from only customers who match the demography of the company's overall customer base.
B. Collect data from customers who have a past purchase history.
C. Ensure that the data is balanced and collected from a diverse group.
D. Ensure that the data is from a publicly available dataset.

**Correct answer:** C. Ensure that the data is balanced and collected from a diverse group.

To build a responsible and fair Machine Learning (ML) model, it is crucial to address bias at the source, which is often the training data. Collecting data from a diverse and balanced group of customers ensures that the model is trained on a representative sample of the entire potential user population. This practice minimizes the risk of the model developing biases that would cause it to perform poorly or unfairly for underrepresented groups, which is a core principle of responsible AI development. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Using data only from the current customer base can reinforce existing demographic skews and create sampling bias, where the model fails to generalize to new or different customer groups. B. Collecting data only from customers with a purchase history introduces selection bias by ignoring new customers or those who browse but haven't purchased, leading to a narrow model. D. Using a publicly available dataset does not guarantee it is free from bias. The quality and representativeness of the data are what matter, not its public or private origin.

A. Use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.
B. Remove personally identifiable information (PII) from the customer data before fine-tuning the LLM.
C. Increase the Top-K parameter of the LLM.
D. Store customer data in Amazon S3. Encrypt the data before fine-tuning the LLM.

**Correct answer:** B. Remove personally identifiable information (PII) from the customer data before fine-tuning the LLM.

The most fundamental and effective method to prevent a model from learning and subsequently revealing private data is to remove that data from the training set before the fine-tuning process begins. By redacting or anonymizing all personally identifiable information (PII), the bank ensures the Large Language Model (LLM) is never exposed to sensitive customer details. This approach addresses the root cause of potential data leakage, as the model cannot memorize or infer information it has never seen. This is a standard best practice in machine learning for maintaining data privacy. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails. Guardrails are applied at inference time to filter user inputs and model responses. They do not prevent the model from learning sensitive data during the fine-tuning phase itself. C. Increase the Top-K parameter of the LLM. Top-K is an inference parameter that controls the randomness of the model's output by limiting the pool of potential next words. It does not relate to data privacy or training data content. D. Store customer data in Amazon S3. Encrypt the data before fine-tuning the LLM. Encryption protects data at rest in Amazon S3. However, the data must be decrypted for the fine-tuning job to process it, at which point the model would be exposed to the PII. ---

A. Implement moderation APIs.
B. Retrain the model with a general public dataset.
C. Perform model validation.
D. Automate user feedback integration.

**Correct answer:** A. Implement moderation APIs.

The most direct and effective solution is to implement a moderation API. Services like Amazon Rekognition provide content moderation capabilities specifically designed to detect unsafe, inappropriate, or unwanted content in images. By integrating such an API, the company can create a real-time filter. The chatbot's image generation or retrieval process would first pass the candidate image through the moderation API. If the API flags the image as inappropriate based on predefined or custom rules (e.g., explicit nudity, violence), the chatbot can prevent it from being sent to the user, thus proactively ensuring a safe user experience. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Retrain the model with a general public dataset. Using a general, unfiltered public dataset would likely introduce more inappropriate content, worsening the problem rather than solving it. C. Perform model validation. Model validation is a testing phase to assess performance before deployment. It does not provide a real-time, continuous mechanism to filter content in a production environment. D. Automate user feedback integration. This is a reactive approach. It relies on users being exposed to inappropriate content first and then flagging it, failing the requirement to prevent such images from being returned.

How should the bank fix this issue MOST cost-effectively?

A. Include more diverse training data. Fine-tune the model again by using the new data.
B. Use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the fine-tuned model.
C. Use AWS Trusted Advisor checks to eliminate bias.
D. Pre-train a new LLM with more diverse training data.

**Correct answer:** A. Include more diverse training data. Fine-tune the model again by using the new data.

The most cost-effective and direct method to address bias in a fine-tuned model is to improve the dataset used for that fine-tuning. The bias described likely originates from an unrepresentative or skewed dataset used during the fine-tuning stage. By augmenting the dataset with more diverse and balanced examples covering all demographics and then re-running the fine-tuning process, the bank can directly teach the model to make fairer decisions. This approach is significantly less expensive than pre-training a new model from scratch and is more targeted at fixing decision-making bias than using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the fine-tuned model. RAG is designed to augment a model's knowledge with external data, reducing hallucinations and providing up-to-date information. It does not fundamentally alter the model's biased decision-making logic. C. Use AWS Trusted Advisor checks to eliminate bias. AWS Trusted Advisor is a service for optimizing AWS infrastructure regarding cost, performance, and security. It has no capability to analyze or mitigate bias in machine learning models. D. Pre-train a new LLM with more diverse training data.

A. Reduce the size of the training dataset.
B. Ensure that the ML model predictions are consistent with historical results.
C. Create a different ML model for each demographic group.
D. Measure class imbalance on the training dataset. Adapt the training process accordingly.

**Correct answer:** D. Measure class imbalance on the training dataset. Adapt the training process accordingly.

To develop an unbiased Machine Learning (ML) model, it is critical to first identify and then mitigate sources of bias in the training data. Class imbalance, where certain outcomes or groups are disproportionately represented, is a common source of bias. For a loan allocation model, historical data might show fewer approvals for certain demographics, not due to creditworthiness but due to historical biases. Measuring this class imbalance is the first step. Subsequently, the training process can be adapted using techniques like re-sampling (e.g., SMOTE) or applying class weights to ensure the model learns from all groups equitably, rather than simply optimizing for the majority class. This approach directly addresses a root cause of data-induced bias. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Reducing the size of the training dataset generally increases the risk of sampling bias and poor generalization, which would likely worsen model fairness and performance. B. Ensuring consistency with historical results is counterproductive, as it would train the model to replicate and amplify any existing biases present in the historical data. C. Creating a different ML model for each demographic group can lead to disparate treatment and may not solve the underlying data imbalance issues within each group.

320. A company uses a third-party model on Amazon Bedrock to analyze confidential documents. The company is concerned about data privacy. Which statement describes how Amazon Bedrock protects data privacy?

A. User inputs and model outputs are anonymized and shared with third-party model providers.
B. User inputs and model outputs are not shared with any third-party model providers.
C. User inputs are kept confidential, but model outputs are shared with third-party model providers.
D. User inputs and model outputs are redacted before the inputs and outputs are shared with third- party model providers.

**Correct answer:** B. User inputs and model outputs are not shared with any third-party model providers.

Amazon Bedrock is designed with a foundational principle of data privacy and security. When a customer uses a third-party model through the Bedrock service, their content, which includes both the inputs (prompts) and the model-generated outputs (completions), is never shared with the third-party model provider. The entire inference process occurs within the secure AWS environment. This ensures that confidential data remains private and is not used for any purpose by the model provider, including the training or improvement of their base models. All customer data is encrypted at rest and in transit and remains within the AWS network. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Data is not shared with third-party providers in any form, including anonymized. The principle is complete data isolation from the provider. C. Neither inputs nor outputs are shared. The data privacy protection applies to the entire data exchange with the model. D. The core security promise is that data is not shared at all, making the concept of sharing redacted data incorrect.

321. Which scenario describes a potential risk and limitation of prompt engineering In the context of a generative AI model?

A. Prompt engineering does not ensure that the model always produces consistent and deterministic outputs, eliminating the need for validation.
B. Prompt engineering could expose the model to vulnerabilities such as prompt injection attacks.
C. Properly designed prompts reduce but do not eliminate the risk of data poisoning or model hijacking.
D. Prompt engineering does not ensure that the model will consistently generate highly reliable outputs when working with real-world data.

**Correct answer:** B. Prompt engineering could expose the model to vulnerabilities such as prompt injection attacks.

Prompt engineering, while powerful for guiding generative AI models, introduces a significant security vulnerability known as prompt injection. An attacker can craft a malicious prompt that overrides the system's original instructions. This can trick the model into performing unintended actions, such as bypassing content filters, revealing sensitive information, or executing harmful commands. This represents a direct risk and a fundamental limitation in controlling model behavior solely through natural language prompts, as the model may not distinguish between a developer's instructions and a malicious user's input within the same prompt. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. This statement is logically incorrect. The fact that prompt engineering does not ensure deterministic outputs increases the need for robust validation and testing, it does not eliminate it. C. Data poisoning is an attack on the model's training data, which occurs before the model is deployed. Prompt engineering is an inference-time technique used after the model is already trained. D. This describes a general limitation of the underlying AI model (lack of consistent reliability), which prompt engineering aims to mitigate. Prompt injection (B) is a specific security risk introduced by the prompt-based interface.

A. Fact-check the output of the large language model (LLM).
B. Compare the output of the large language model (LLM) to the results of an internet search.
C. Use contextual grounding.
D. Use relevance grounding.

**Correct answer:** C. Use contextual grounding.

Contextual grounding is a primary strategy to prevent model hallucinations. This technique involves providing a large language model (LLM) with a specific, verified set of information (the "context" or "ground truth") and instructing it to generate responses based solely on that provided data. This process, often implemented through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, anchors the model's output to a factual knowledge base, significantly reducing the likelihood of it inventing or fabricating information. By constraining the model to a trusted source, it is prevented from generating responses based on potentially incorrect or irrelevant information from its original training data. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Fact-checking the output of the large language model (LLM). This is a reactive measure to detect hallucinations after they have already occurred, not a strategy to prevent them during generation. B. Compare the output of the large language model (LLM) to the results of an internet search. This is a form of post-generation verification, similar to fact-checking. It helps identify errors but does not prevent the model from making them initially. D. Use relevance grounding. "Relevance grounding" is not a standard industry term. The correct and more comprehensive term is "contextual grounding," which ensures the model's output is both relevant and factually based on the provided source.

A. Fuzzing training data to find vulnerabilities
B. Denial of service (DoS)
C. Penetration testing with authorization
D. Jailbreak

**Correct answer:** D. Jailbreak

Jailbreaking is a form of adversarial attack specifically targeting foundation models (FMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). It involves crafting specialized prompts (prompt engineering) to circumvent the model's built-in safety and ethics filters. The objective is to trick the model into generating responses that violate its own usage policies, such as producing harmful, biased, or otherwise restricted content. This technique directly aligns with the scenario of testing security by getting around safety features to create harmful content. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Fuzzing training data to find vulnerabilities: Fuzzing involves inputting random or malformed data to find software bugs. While one could fuzz a model's input prompts, fuzzing the training data is not the standard method for bypassing a deployed model's safety features. B. Denial of service (DoS): A DoS attack's goal is to overwhelm a system to make it unavailable to legitimate users. This does not involve manipulating the model's output to generate specific harmful content. C. Penetration testing with authorization: This is a very broad term for authorized security testing.

A. Prompted persona switches
B. Exploiting friendliness and trust
C. Ignoring the prompt template
D. Extracting the prompt template

**Correct answer:** D. Extracting the prompt template

An attack focused on extracting the prompt template, also known as prompt leaking, is a specific type of prompt injection designed to make the large language model (LLM) reveal its own system prompt. The system prompt contains the foundational instructions, rules, and configurations that govern the model's behavior, personality, and constraints. By tricking the model into outputting these instructions (e.g., by asking "What are your initial instructions?" or "Repeat the text above"), an attacker directly exposes the LLM's configured behavior. This information can then be used to understand and bypass its safety mechanisms. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Prompted persona switches involve instructing the model to adopt a new character, which overrides its configured behavior rather than exposing it. B. Exploiting friendliness and trust is a social engineering technique used to persuade the model to bypass its rules, not to reveal the rules themselves. C. Ignoring the prompt template is a user action that typically leads to a suboptimal response, not a security vulnerability that exposes the model's internal configuration.

B. Use a deep learning model with many hidden layers.
C. Keep the model's decision-making process a secret to protect proprietary algorithms.
D. Continuously monitor the model's performance on a static test dataset.

**Correct answer:** A. Review the training data to check for biases. Include data from all demographics in the training data.

Building a responsible and fair AI application, especially for critical decisions like loan approvals, begins with the data used to train the model. Historical data can contain societal biases, which the model will learn and perpetuate if not addressed. By reviewing the training data for biases and ensuring it is representative of all demographic groups, the company directly mitigates a primary source of unfairness. This foundational step is crucial for developing a model that makes equitable decisions, aligning with the principles of responsible AI. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B: A deep learning model's complexity (number of layers) is related to its capacity to learn patterns, not its inherent fairness. Complex models can even make it harder to detect and explain biases. C: Secrecy is contrary to the principle of transparency in responsible AI. To ensure fairness and accountability, the model's decision-making process should be explainable, not hidden. D: Monitoring on a static test dataset is insufficient.

342. Which type of ML technique provides the MOST explainability?

A. Linear regression
B. Support vector machines
C. Random cut forest (RCF)
D. Neural network

**Correct answer:** A. Linear regression

Linear regression is considered a "white-box" model, offering the highest degree of explainability among the choices. Its mathematical form is a simple weighted sum of the input features. Each feature's coefficient (weight) directly and clearly quantifies its contribution to the prediction. A positive coefficient means an increase in the feature's value leads to an increase in the predicted outcome, and its magnitude indicates the strength of this relationship. This straightforward, linear relationship makes the model's decisions easy for humans to understand and interpret. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Support vector machines: The decision boundary can be highly non-linear (with kernels), making it difficult to attribute the outcome to individual input features in a simple, direct way. C. Random cut forest (RCF): As an ensemble, unsupervised algorithm, explaining why a specific point is an anomaly based on its isolation across many random trees is complex and not intuitive. D. Neural network: These are classic "black-box" models. Their deep, layered structure with non-linear activations creates highly complex relationships that are inherently difficult to interpret directly.

B. Use chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.
C. Use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
D. Provide a persona and tone in the prompt.

**Correct answer:** D. Provide a persona and tone in the prompt.

Prompt engineering is the process of structuring text that is interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. To ensure an AI assistant's responses align with a company's brand, a direct and effective technique is to explicitly define a persona and tone within the prompt itself. For example, including instructions like "You are a helpful and professional customer service assistant for Company X. Respond in a friendly and clear tone" guides the model to generate outputs that match the desired representation, directly addressing the issue of poor company perception. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Zero-shot prompting simply asks the model to perform a task without examples. It does not provide any guidance on the style, tone, or persona of the response. B. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique to improve a model's reasoning on complex, multi-step problems. It does not control the persona or tone of the final answer. C. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances a model's responses with factual information from an external knowledge base but does not inherently control the stylistic delivery of that information.

344. A financial company is developing a generative AI application for loan approval decisions. The company needs the application output to be responsible and fair.

A. Review the training data to check for biases. Include data from all demographics in the training data.
B. Use a deep learning model with many hidden layers.
C. Keep the model's decision-making process a secret to protect proprietary algorithms.
D. Continuously monitor the model's performance on a static test dataset.

**Correct answer:** A. Review the training data to check for biases. Include data from all demographics in the training data.

To ensure a generative AI application for loan approvals is responsible and fair, the most critical first step is to address bias at its source: the training data. Historical data in finance can reflect societal biases, which the model will learn and perpetuate if not corrected. By reviewing the training data for biases and ensuring it is representative of all demographic groups, the company can proactively mitigate the risk of the model making discriminatory decisions. This practice is a foundational principle of the Fairness and Inclusivity pillar within the AWS Responsible AI framework. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Use a deep learning model with many hidden layers. Model complexity does not ensure fairness. In fact, highly complex models can be less transparent, making it harder to audit them for biased decision-making processes. C. Keep the model's decision-making process a secret to protect proprietary algorithms. This contradicts the principle of transparency and explainability in responsible AI. To ensure fairness and build trust, the model's decision-making process must be auditable and understandable. D. Continuously monitor the model's performance on a static test dataset. While monitoring is important, using a static dataset is insufficient as it doesn't account for real-world data drift. Furthermore, this option focuses on general "performance" rather than specifically monitoring for fairness metrics.

C. Test the AI solution to ensure that it does not discriminate against any protected groups.
D. Keep the AI decision-making process confidential to maintain a competitive advantage.

**Correct answer:** C. Test the AI solution to ensure that it does not discriminate against any protected groups.

The core principle of responsible AI, particularly in sensitive applications like hiring, is to ensure fairness and mitigate bias. Testing the AI solution to ensure it does not discriminate against protected groups directly addresses this principle. AWS provides tools like Amazon SageMaker Clarify specifically to help developers detect statistical bias in their data and models before and after training. This proactive testing is a critical step in building an equitable and compliant AI system, aligning with the "Fairness and Equity" pillar of the AWS Responsible AI framework. This practice helps ensure that decisions are based on job-relevant qualifications rather than demographic attributes. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. This violates the principle of human-in-the-loop. For high-stakes decisions like hiring, AI should augment, not replace, human judgment to ensure accountability and handle nuanced cases. B. This introduces significant selection bias. Training a model only on past successful hires will cause the model to perpetuate and amplify any existing biases in historical hiring practices. D. This contradicts the principle of explainability. Stakeholders, including auditors and candidates, may need to understand how a decision was made to ensure fairness and build trust.

A. Prompt injection
B. Data bias
C. Hallucination
D. Data exposure

**Correct answer:** A. Prompt injection

The user's message is a direct example of a prompt injection attack. This type of attack involves crafting malicious input to manipulate a Large Language Model (LLM) into performing unintended actions. The user is attempting to override the AI's pre-programmed instructions and safety filters by "injecting" a new, superseding directive. This technique exploits the model's ability to follow instructions given in the prompt, aiming to bypass its intended operational constraints. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Data bias: This refers to skewed or prejudiced outputs resulting from biases present in the model's training data, not from a malicious user input. C. Hallucination: This is when an AI model generates factually incorrect or nonsensical information. It is an output error, whereas prompt injection is an input-based attack. D. Data exposure: This is the unintentional leakage of sensitive information. While a successful prompt injection attack could potentially lead to data exposure, the attack itself is the injection.

364. A company needs to share a dataset with a third-party provider. The provider will use the dataset to create an ML model. Some fields in the dataset contain personally identifiable information (PII). The company needs a solution to share this dataset without exposing PII. Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Apply data masking to all fields in the dataset.
B. Apply data masking to the fields that contain PII in the dataset.
C. Apply data encryption to all fields in the dataset.
D. Apply data labeling to the fields that contain PII in the dataset.

**Correct answer:** B. Apply data masking to the fields that contain PII in the dataset.

The goal is to protect personally identifiable information (PII) while allowing a third party to use the dataset for machine learning. Data masking is a technique that replaces sensitive data with realistic but non-sensitive fictional data. Applying masking specifically to the PII fields protects the sensitive information while preserving the format and utility of the rest of the dataset for model training. This targeted approach is both effective for privacy and efficient, as it doesn't alter data that is not sensitive. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Applying data masking to all fields is unnecessary and would likely degrade the dataset's utility for training an effective ML model. C. Applying data encryption would require sharing the decryption key with the third party, defeating the purpose of protecting the PII from them. D. Applying data labeling only identifies the PII fields; it does not remove, hide, or otherwise protect the sensitive information itself.

Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Enable AWS Audit Manager for automatic model evaluation jobs. AWS Audit Manager is a compliance and audit service; it collects evidence for audits but does not directly secure the real-time usage of LLMs. C. Enable Amazon Bedrock automatic model evaluation jobs. Model evaluation is for assessing a model's performance on metrics like accuracy or toxicity. It's a governance tool, not a primary security mechanism for controlling access. D. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to make models explainable and to monitor for bias. CloudWatch Logs are for monitoring and logging API calls (a detective control), but they do not inherently provide model explainability or bias detection capabilities.

367. A financial company uses a generative AI model to assign credit limits to new customers. The company wants to make the decision-making process of the model more transparent to its customers.

A. Use a rule-based system instead of an ML model
B. Apply explainable AI techniques to show customers which factors influenced the model's decision
C. Develop an interactive UI for customers and provide clear technical explanations about the system
D. Increase the accuracy of the model to reduce the need for transparency

**Correct answer:** B. Apply explainable AI techniques to show customers which factors influenced the model's decision

The most direct and effective way to make a generative AI model's decision-making process transparent is by applying Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. XAI methods, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), are specifically designed to provide insights into why a model made a particular prediction. For a financial company, this means it can identify and communicate the key factors (e.g., income level, credit history) that led to a specific credit limit assignment for an individual customer. This directly addresses the need for transparency and is a cornerstone of building trustworthy and responsible AI systems, especially in regulated industries like finance. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. This suggests replacing the model, not making the existing one more transparent. While rule-based systems are inherently interpretable, this approach discards the potential performance benefits of the AI model. C. A user interface and general technical explanations do not clarify the reasoning behind a specific decision for an individual customer, which is the core requirement for transparency in this context. D. Model accuracy and transparency are distinct concepts. A highly accurate model can still be a "black box," and in many domains, especially finance, regulatory compliance requires explainability regardless of accuracy.

368. A company plans to build an AI model for the company's global customer base. The company wants to train the model on a dataset that reflects user diversity. Which action will meet this requirement?

A. Balance class representation in the dataset.
B. Use a regional dataset with complete data.
C. Oversample majority class data.
D. Drop minority class data records.

**Correct answer:** A. Balance class representation in the dataset.

To build a model for a global customer base that reflects user diversity, it is crucial to prevent model bias. Balancing class representation in the dataset is a fundamental technique to ensure that minority groups are adequately represented. This prevents the model from becoming skewed towards the majority groups, leading to fairer and more accurate predictions across the diverse user population. This practice is a core principle of responsible and fair AI development. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Using a regional dataset would introduce significant bias and fail to represent a global user base, making the model perform poorly for users outside that region. C. Oversampling the majority class would worsen any existing class imbalance, making the model even more biased and less representative of user diversity. D. Dropping minority class data records (undersampling) removes valuable information about diverse users, leading to a biased model that performs poorly for those groups.

388. A company is using custom models in Amazon Bedrock for a generative AI application. The company wants to use a company-managed encryption key to encrypt the model artifacts that the model customization jobs create. Which AWS service meets these requirements?

A. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
B. Amazon Inspector
C. Amazon Macie
D. AWS Secrets Manager

**Correct answer:** A. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)

Amazon Bedrock integrates with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt data, including custom model artifacts. When creating a model customization job, you can specify a customer-managed key from AWS KMS. This allows a company to use its own encryption key, which it creates, owns, and manages, to encrypt the model artifacts. This directly meets the requirement of using a company-managed key for encryption within the Amazon Bedrock service. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: B. Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure; it does not manage encryption keys. C. Amazon Macie is a data security service that uses machine learning to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in Amazon S3; it is not used for key management. D. AWS Secrets Manager is a service for managing and retrieving secrets, such as database credentials and API keys, not for managing the cryptographic keys used to encrypt data artifacts.

389. A company wants to set up private access to Amazon Bedrock APIs from the company's AWS account. The company also wants to protect its data from internet exposure.

A. Use Amazon CloudFront to restrict access to the company's private content
B. Use AWS Glue to set up data encryption across the company's data catalog
C. Use AWS Lake Formation to manage centralized data governance and cross-account data sharing
D. Use AWS PrivateLink to configure a private connection between the company's VPC and Amazon Bedrock

**Correct answer:** D. Use AWS PrivateLink to configure a private connection between the company's VPC and Amazon Bedrock

AWS PrivateLink provides secure, private connectivity between Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), AWS services, and on-premises applications, without exposing traffic to the public internet. By creating an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Bedrock, the company can ensure that all API calls from their VPC to Bedrock are routed through the AWS private network. This directly addresses the requirements to establish private access and protect data from internet exposure, as the connection does not traverse the public internet. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) used to distribute content publicly with low latency. It does not provide private API access from a VPC. B. AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service for ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs. It is unrelated to providing private network access to AWS APIs. C. AWS Lake Formation is a service for building, securing, and managing data lakes. It governs data access but does not manage network connectivity to services like Bedrock.

390. A financial company wants to build workflows for human review of ML predictions. The company wants to define confidence thresholds for its use case and adjust the threshold over time. Which AWS service meets these requirements?

A. Amazon Personalize
B. Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I)
C. Amazon Inspector
D. AWS Audit Manager

**Correct answer:** B. Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I)

Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) is a service specifically designed to build and manage workflows for human review of machine learning predictions. It allows organizations to specify conditions, such as confidence score thresholds, to determine when a prediction needs to be routed to a human for review. The financial company can define an initial confidence threshold (e.g., send predictions with less than 95% confidence for review) and then adjust this threshold over time to optimize for accuracy and cost. This directly addresses all the requirements stated in the question for building human review workflows with adjustable confidence thresholds. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Amazon Personalize is a machine learning service for creating real-time personalized recommendations; it does not provide a framework for human review of ML predictions. C. Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continuously scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. D. AWS Audit Manager is a compliance service that helps you continuously audit your AWS usage to simplify risk assessment and compliance with regulations.

✔ Domain 3: Applications of Foundation Models · Multiple choice

391. A company is using an Amazon Nova Canvas model to generate images. The model generates images successfully. The company needs to prevent the model from including specific items in the generated images. Which solution will meet this requirement?

A. Use a higher temperature value.
B. Use a more detailed prompt.
C. Use a negative prompt.
D. Use another foundation model (FM).

**Correct answer:** C. Use a negative prompt.

Negative prompts are a specific feature in generative AI image models, including those available through Amazon Bedrock like Titan Image Generator. This feature allows users to provide a list of concepts, styles, or objects that they want to explicitly exclude from the generated image. By specifying the unwanted items in a negative prompt, the company can directly instruct the model to avoid generating them, thus meeting the requirement precisely and efficiently. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Use a higher temperature value. This is incorrect. Temperature controls the randomness of the output. A higher value increases creativity and randomness, which would likely make the inclusion of unwanted items more probable, not less. B. Use a more detailed prompt. This is incorrect. A detailed prompt describes what to include in the image. While it guides the model, it does not explicitly instruct it on what to exclude, making it an indirect and less reliable method. D. Use another foundation model (FM). This is incorrect. While switching models might incidentally solve the issue, it is not a direct solution. It is an inefficient workaround that doesn't guarantee the new model won't have similar issues.

392. A company wants to make a chatbot to help customers. The chatbot will help solve technical problems without human intervention. The company chose a foundation model (FM) for the chatbot. The chatbot needs to produce responses that adhere to company tone. Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Set a low limit on the number of tokens the FM can produce.
B. Use batch inferencing to process detailed responses.
C. Refine the prompt until the FM produces the desired responses.
D. Define a higher number for the temperature parameter.

**Correct answer:** C. Refine the prompt until the FM produces the desired responses.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the input (prompt) given to a foundation model (FM) to elicit a desired output. To ensure the chatbot's responses adhere to a specific company tone, the most direct and effective method is to refine the prompt. This involves providing explicit instructions within the prompt about the desired persona, style, and tone (e.g., "You are a helpful and professional support agent. Your tone must be formal and empathetic."). This technique guides the model's generation process without altering its underlying parameters or architecture. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Set a low limit on the number of tokens the FM can produce. This controls the response length, not its tone. A low token limit would likely result in incomplete and unhelpful answers for technical problems. B. Use batch inferencing to process detailed responses. Batch inferencing is a method for processing multiple inputs offline for efficiency. It does not influence the tone or style of the generated output for a real-time chatbot. D. Define a higher number for the temperature parameter. The temperature parameter controls randomness. A higher temperature increases creativity and variability, making the tone less consistent and less likely to adhere to a specific company standard.

✔ Domain 4: Guidelines for Responsible AI · Multiple choice

393. A company designed an AI-powered agent to answer customer inquiries based on product manuals. Which strategy can improve customer confidence levels in the AI-powered agent's responses?

A. Writing the confidence level in the response
B. Including referenced product manual links in the response
C. Designing an agent avatar that looks like a computer
D. Training the agent to respond in the company's language style

**Correct answer:** B. Including referenced product manual links in the response

Including links to the referenced product manuals directly in the agent's response is the most effective strategy for improving customer confidence. This practice, known as source attribution, provides transparency and allows users to independently verify the accuracy of the information. By showing the source, the system demonstrates that its answers are grounded in factual documentation rather than being unverified or "hallucinated." This verifiability is a cornerstone of building trust in AI-powered information systems. Why Incorrect Options are Wrong: A. Writing the confidence level in the response: A numerical confidence score is a technical metric that is often meaningless to a non-technical user and can decrease trust if the score is not perceived as high enough. C. Designing an agent avatar that looks like a computer: The visual design of an avatar is a user interface choice that does not inherently impact the trustworthiness or factual accuracy of the agent's responses. D. Training the agent to respond in the company's language style: While aligning the agent's tone with the company's brand improves user experience, it does not provide any proof of the answer's accuracy or increase its verifiability.
